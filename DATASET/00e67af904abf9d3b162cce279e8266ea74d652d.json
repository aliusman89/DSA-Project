Cervical cancer is a preventable disease, with several strategies for prevention and treatment, but it is mostly prevented through human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination efforts. World Health Organization announced the \"Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem\" in November 2020 [1] . It has suggested vaccinating 90 percent of girls against multiple strains of HPV by 15 years of age [1] . However, although higher income countries tend to achieve higher vaccine coverage, coverage remains low in some high-income countries such as 46% in the U.S. and 31% in Germany (target population who received the last dose of HPV vaccine in 2018) [2] . A recent study estimated the final dose of HPV vaccine coverage in 2019 for females remained at only 40% in high income countries, and much lower in other countries [3] .",

Following the revision of the Japanese immunization law in April 2013, HPV vaccines were positioned in \"Routine A\" of the Vaccines 2022, 10, 701 2 of 12 national immunization program [4] . Although the vaccines in Routine A are not mandatory, the local governments provide individual recommendations known as \"proactive recommendations\". Girls in the sixth year of elementary school to the first year of high school who wish to receive the HPV vaccines can do so free of charge at a local clinic because the vaccination costs are covered by public funds. However, proactive recommendation of HPV vaccination was suspended by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in June 2013 in Japan after negative campaigns by mass media about severe adverse reactions allegedly caused by HPV vaccination [5] . Notifications and vaccination coupons to encourage vaccination were no longer sent to girls of eligible ages due to the suspension. Since then, the HPV vaccination rate among age-eligible girls has been stagnating, with less than one percent of girls being vaccinated [2] . Vaccine hesitancy-the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines-has been listed by the WHO as one of the top 10 global health threats and is also a critical issue in HPV vaccination [6, 7] .",

In recent years, researchers have discussed the introduction of an evolutionary perspective into health behavior research [13, 14] , and The Lancet published an evolutionary public health series in 2017 [15] [16] [17] . Those studies suggest that, in order to understand health behavior, we must connect the various choices we make in our day-to-day lives with their evolutionary meaning. Evolutionary biologists have presumed that all living organisms have been selected to maximize their relative success at passing genes on to future generations via either direct reproduction or helping kin reproduce, which they call inclusive fitness [18] .",

A fundamental motive can be activated and become paramount by external or internal cues that indicate threats or opportunities related to a specific evolutionally challenge [12, 19, 23] . Each of the seven fundamental motives is assumed to develop in stages as an individual grows through childhood and adolescence to old age, based on the life history theory [24] ; even as later-developing motives become paramount, earlierdeveloped motives are ready to be active whenever pertinent threats or opportunities are perceived to arise [12, 19, 20] . For example, in the mature life stage, the fundamental motives of mate retention and kin care are paramount and guide decisions (e.g., when one becomes a parent, the care of one's child becomes a top priority). Therefore, it is important to presume an audience's paramount fundamental motive and target it when encouraging health behaviors, including vaccination.",

Regarding the mean values for intention of vaccination after the intervention, ANOVA and multiple comparisons revealed the same trend as the absolute change. Regarding the absolute change in mean values for attitude toward vaccination before and after the intervention, ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of the group assignment [F(2, 966) = 23.457, p < 0.001, \u03b7 2 = 0.046]. The Games-Howell post hoc test revealed significant differences between the kin care and the control groups (M = 0.38 vs. M = 0.08, p < 0.001), and the disease avoidance and the control groups (M = 0.30 vs. M = 0.08, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference between the two intervention groups.

Previous research and practice on behavior change, including vaccination recommendations, have been based mainly on cognitive behavioral models, and focused on cognitive beliefs such as perceived susceptibility and severity of infection [9, 10] . Previous studies have shown that many vaccine recommendation messages target the fundamental motive of disease avoidance and communicate the causes of infectious diseases and the benefits of vaccines (e.g., Let's get vaccinated because vaccines prevent infection) [25, 26, 30] . However, repeated exposure to messages with similar themes generates a psychological reactance and disengagement toward incoming messages, leading to ineffective persuasive outcomes [28, 29] . Therefore, the results of this study imply that health professionals should deliver messages that target not only the fundamental motive of disease avoidance, but also the fundamental motive of kin care, to increase the effectiveness of communication to encourage HPV vaccination.",

First, low health literacy levels are associated with low acceptance of the HPV vaccine [40] . General vaccine information requires a certain level of literacy and numeracy to understand, making it difficult for those with low health literacy to understand and use vaccine information [41, 42] . However, messages that target the fundamental motive of kin care are simple and straightforward and may influence people of all health literacy levels. Second, health organizations and professionals are recommended to deliver effective tailored messages for addressing vaccine hesitancy [43, 44] . Messages that target the fundamental motive of kin care can be used to deliver tailored personally relevant messages, which is recommended to amplify vaccine affirmation [45] . Third, messages that target the fundamental motive of kin care can be used in multiple channels-which are also recommended for effective vaccine communication-such as online, offline and face-to-face communication [44, 46, 47] . For example, provision of HPV vaccine information by trusted health care providers, combined with the provision of influential HPV vaccine information, can increase confidence to receive HPV vaccination [48] [49] [50] . Messages that target the fundamental motive of kin care can be used in such integrated HPV vaccine communication approach by embedding the message in various channels.",

First, although participants were instructed to read messages carefully before reading the intervention or control message, it is unclear to what extent the participants perused the messages. Second, because the content of the control message was not associated with HPV vaccination, it cannot be determined that the intervention messages targeting the fundamental motives encouraged vaccination. For example, the results of this study may have just detected an effect of HPV vaccination information. However, we created the intervention disease avoidance message that mimics typical existing HPV vaccination recommendation messages in Japan. Therefore, the results indicate that the kin care message was as effective as existing messages, and they have important implications to extend strategies of HPV vaccination communication as mentioned earlier. Third, this study assessed vaccination intentions directly after message exposure. Our previous study showed that HPV vaccination intention 4 months after intervention using statistics, a patient's and a mother's narrative had decreased to a level that did not differ significantly from the level prior to intervention [51] . Future studies should examine the long-term effects of messages using an evolutionary approach because they are important in this context given that HPV vaccination requires multiple injections over a series of weeks. Fourth, this study assessed vaccination intentions rather than actual vaccination behaviors; future studies should examine the effects of messages on actual vaccination behaviors. Fifth, the possibility of spillover effects between groups cannot be completely ruled out; although since this is an internet survey and not a study conducted in one limited site or region, the possibility of spillover effects is considered small.
