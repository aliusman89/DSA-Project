The biological process of aging is associated with the degeneration of organs, which results in different physical and mental health problems, including vision and hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, physical and mental disabilities and musculoskeletal, neurological, gastrointestinal and endocrine disorders. These problems can reduce older people's ability to independently perform their daily life activities, leading to their dependence on others, particularly their family members [2] . Healthcare providers involved in home care for older people should assess the degree of their clients' dependency on family members, given the impact of such dependency on the well-being and quality of life of both older people and their families [3] [4] [5] .",

The sources of support for older people vary, based on the immediate sociocultural context and healthcare approaches to aging. For instance, the main source of emotional support for older people in the United States is informal support from friends [9, 10] , while in Asian transitional countries, including Iran, family members are the main sources of support for fulfilling their expectations and meeting their physical, mental and emotional needs [11] [12] [13] .",

Older people will constitute 21.7% of the Iranian population by 2050, as 1 in 3 of them will be older than 60 years [22, 23] . Older people are considered sources of love and emotional support in Iranian families. Therefore, older people receive care from their family members in their own home, avoiding transition to long-term healthcare settings, such as nursing homes. It is noted that the current healthcare system in Iran cannot coherently meet the holistic needs of older people [24, 25] . Additionally, transition from the personal own home to the nursing home environment has been interpreted as the loss of family support and independence in performing daily life routines, leading to negative psychological experiences [26] . Home care helps with the preservation of older people's dignity and reduces healthcare costs [27] . Therefore, Iranian families often play the role of caregivers for older parents at home in order to fulfil their sacred duties to them in their time of disability [5, 13] . Children grow up and leave their older parents to develop their own independent lives, but they preserve family connections with them. Therefore, Iranian older people live on their own and in their own homes, and receive support from their children and family members. Their children provide various types of support for their older parents, take responsibility for managing their life affairs and spend their leisure time with them.",

For instance, the number of post-death worshipping days in Korea has reduced, and the funeral ceremony has become simpler [46] . Some people in Ghana are mainly concerned with the financial costs of the funeral ceremony and its impact on personal and familial respect [48] .
