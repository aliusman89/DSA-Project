Of these 117 HCWs, there were no breakthrough infections during the study period. The baseline characteristics of the natural infection group and the two vaccination groups are shown in Table 1 . In the natural infection group, the median titer of S1-specific IgG peaked at 1 month after infection and significantly decreased by 6 months (1252-106.8 IU/ml, Figure 2A ). At peak immunity, the S1-specific antibody titer was significantly higher in the BNT162b2 group than in the natural infection group; however, the titres were comparable between the two groups at 6 months. The ChAdOx1 group showed a significantly lower S1-specific antibody response than the natural infection group or the BNT162b2 group both at peak immunity and at 6 months. The detailed kinetics of the S1-specific antibody titer over 6 months in the three groups are shown in Figure 3A and Figure S1 .

The detailed kinetics of neutralising antibody titres to the ancestral strain over 6 months in the three groups are shown in Figure 3B . The neutralising antibody titres to the delta variant at 6 months were significantly higher in the natural infection group (391.1) than in the BNT162b2 (166.5, P = .003) and ChA-dOX1 (110.6, P < .001) groups, while the titres in the two vaccination groups were comparable (P = .17; Figure 2C) . A comparison of antibody responses according to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is shown in the Extended Results section of Supporting Information. Interferon-\u03b3-producing T-cell responses showed a decreasing trend over 6 months in all three groups. At the peak immune response, the BNT162b2 group showed the highest T-cell response (155 SFC/500,000 PBMCs) compared with the natural infection group (50.50 SFC/500,000 PBMCs; P = .02) or the ChA-dOx1 group (84.50 SFC/500,000 PBMCs; P = .26), while the T-cell responses in the natural infection group and the BNT162b2 group were comparable at 6 months (P = .63; Figure 2D , Figure S2 ). Data regarding the duration of the protective effect after ChAdOx1 are limited. In a population-based cohort study from Brazil and Scotland, hospital admissions and death increased 3 months after the second dose of ChAdOx1, 4 suggesting the waning vaccine effectiveness induced by ChAdOx1 vaccination. Moreover, there are a few comparative data for waning immunity between the two vaccine platforms. In this study, we found that the breakthrough infection rate increased as time passed after vaccination, but there was no significant difference in the breakthrough infection rate between HCWs who received ChAdOx1 and those who received mRNA vaccines. Our findings were further consolidated by the results that neutralising antibody levels against the delta variant after BNT162b2 vaccination declined rapidly and were similar at 6 months between the BNT162b2 group and the ChAdOx1 group. However, the antibody titres at 6 months, especially those against the delta variant, were significantly higher in the natural infection group than in either of the COVID-19 vaccination groups, which implies the longevity and robustness of the immune response after natural infection compared with COVID-19 vaccination. Our findings are consistent with recent epidemiological studies that reported long-term protective immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a more than 80% reduction in the risk of reinfection over 7 months following primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. 3, 5, 6 F I G U R E 2 Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses over 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 natural infection and COVID-19 vaccination.
