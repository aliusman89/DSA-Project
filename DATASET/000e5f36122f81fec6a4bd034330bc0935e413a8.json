Five lab, field, and online studies reveal an important boundary condition to earlier work and demonstrate that consumers perceive robots less negatively when human social presence is the source of discomfort. We show that consumers feel less judged by a robot (vs. a human) when having to engage in an embarrassing service encounter, such as when acquiring medication to treat a sexually transmitted disease or being confronted with one's own mistakes by a frontline employee. As a consequence, consumers prefer being served by a robot instead of a human when having to acquire an embarrassing product, and a robot helps consumers to overcome their reluctance to accept the service provider's offering when the situation becomes embarrassing. However, robot anthropomorphism moderates the effect as consumers ascribe a higher automated social presence to a highly human-like robot (vs. machine-like robot), making consumers feel more socially judged.",

Hence, theoretical and empirical exploration is imperative to uncover how robots' negative effects can be attenuated or perhaps avoided altogether. We investigate whether consumers are more accepting of service robots in situations where human presence causes social discomfort-particularly service settings that can create feelings of being socially judged by the human service provider. A perception of social judgment can arise owing to the product that needs to be acquired, such as condoms (Dahl et al., 2001) , or through interaction with a frontline employee, as when they are confronted with their own errors or forgetfulness (Grace, 2009 ). In such settings, the presence of others can trigger feelings of embarrassment (Argo et al., 2005; Dahl et al., 2001) owing to a fear that negative judgment will pose a threat to one's social identity (Edelmann, 1987; Higuchi & Fukada, 2002) .",

The concept of automated social presence has recently been introduced and is defined as \"the extent to which technology makes customers feel the presence of another social entity\" (van Doorn et al., 2017, p. 43) . Compared to human social presence, automated social presence should lead to lower perception of social judgment. This prediction is in line with a recent study showing that a robot reduces feelings of embarrassment because of its lower perceived agency (i.e., being able to act with intention and form opinions) (Pitardi et al., 2021) . However, whether robotic service translates into a higher likelihood to acquire an embarrassing product or leads to the consumer's greater comfort when facing an embarrassing situation is so far unclear. We expect service robots to make customers feel less judged and more at ease when acquiring an embarrassing product or being disparaged by the service employee, leading to a preference for service robots when the situation becomes embarrassing and to a higher likelihood to accept the service provider's offering.",

While marketing has found anthropomorphism to increase product and brand liking (Aggarwal & McGill, 2012) , whether anthropomorphizing service robots enhances customer experiences is unclear (Blut et al., 2021) . We hypothesize that robot anthropomorphism can trigger higher perceptions of automated social presence because the robot appears livelier and more engaging (Jung & Lee, 2004; van Doorn et al., 2017) . While this effect may be desirable in many situations, robot anthropomorphism and the related heightened automated social presence may backfire when consumers fear social judgment. In these situations, consumers may perceive a highly anthropomorphic robot as more judgmental than a machinelike robot and therefore may be more reluctant to acquire an embarrassing product and more likely to avoid a service provider after an embarrassing encounter. Previous literature has indeed found patients to be less embarrassed during a medical examination when instructed by a technical box than by a robot with human-like features (Bartneck et al., 2010) . Further, more human-like conversational agents elicit more socially desirable responses, and less honest answers, to sensitive questions (Schuetzler et al., 2018) . We propose that these effects may generalize to embarrassing situations in domains beyond healthcare, such as hospitality services, and to interactions with robots with different levels of human likeness.",

Consistent with social identity theory (Edelmann, 1987; Miller & Leary, 1992) , consumers feel less socially judged by a robot than by a human, resulting in a higher likelihood they will accept the service provider's offerings. We link the literature on embarrassment (Dahl et al., 2001; Grace, 2009; Jones et al., 2018) and social identity theory (Edelmann, 1987; Miller & Leary, 1992) to the increasingly important research field of service robots and technology (Huang & Rust, 2017 , 2018 Kumar et al., 2016; van Doorn et al., 2017; Wirtz et al., 2018) . Third, we demonstrate the critical role of a service robot's design in shaping perceptions of automated social presence, in particular the robot's level of anthropomorphism. We show that a more anthropomorphic robot is associated with greater automated social presence, making people feel more judged and hence increasing their tendency to avoid dealing with a company when served by a highly human-like service robot.",

In hospitality services, interacting with a service robot rather than a human employee can trigger feelings of eeriness and human identity threats, leading to consumers' compensatory behaviors such as status consumption and increased food intake (Mende et al., 2019) . The elderly rated a robotic coach lower than a human coach on warmth and competence and as a consequence were less likely to participate in exercise games (\u010cai\u0107 et al., 2019) . However, after a service failure, consumers may evaluate a service robot more favorably than a frontline human service employee (Merkle, 2019) , and robots have been found to reduce embarrassment (Pitardi et al., 2021) . Other research has highlighted that preference for a robot over a human can be task-specific. For instance, older people preferred robotic to human assistance for some instrumental activities such as housekeeping or setting medication reminders but not for other common daily living tasks, such as shaving, walking, or getting dressed (Smarr et al., 2012) . Older people also perceived socially assistive robots as having a positive impact on co-creating service value (e.g., as an extended self, an enabler, and an ally) but also as having codestruction potential (e.g., as a deactivator, a replacement, and an intruder) (\u010cai\u0107 et al., 2018) .",

This theory proposes that amplifying human-likeness increases affinity for the robot until the robot closely resembles a human. Then, a strong feeling of uncanniness occurs, resulting in a radical shift from positive to negative responses because a robot that looks human often cannot enact the expected human behavior (Mori et al., 2012) . Empirical research shows that, as predicted by the theory, anthropomorphizing a robot increases psychological warmth up to a certain point, where it decreases liking owing to a feeling of uncanniness (Kim et al., 2019) . In some cases, making a robot less anthropomorphic decreases negative consumer responses (Mende et al., 2019) . For example, a technical box that gave instructions during a medical examination elicited less embarrassment than an anthropomorphic robot (Bartneck et al., 2010) . Research into anthropomorphism in human-robot interaction has also examined other robot features, such as autonomy (Kahn et al., 2006) . In one study, perceived autonomy of a service robot led to customers feeling lower levels of control and responsibility for positive outcomes (J\u00f6rling et al., 2019) .",

While social presence may enhance service satisfaction when the service experience is positive (He et al., 2012) , scholars have also emphasized potential downsides of social presence (Esmark et al., 2017; Grewal et al., 2020) . One drawback is that the real or imagined social presence of others can result in consumers feeling socially judged in embarrassing situations. This perception leads consumers to avoid purchasing embarrassing products, withdraw as quickly as possible from the embarrassing situation, or avoid the service provider for future transactions (Argo et al., 2005; Dahl et al., 2001; Grace, 2009) . The social evaluation model posits that embarrassment is caused by the feeling of being negatively or undesirably evaluated by others Miller, 1996; . As people have a concern for how they are appraised by others, negative social judgments can evoke a threat to their social identity (Edelmann, 1987; Miller & Leary, 1992) and influence patronage decisions (Grace, 2009 ). This social identity threat corresponds with the premise of social identity theory that an individual strives to achieve a satisfactory image of the self.",

Consumers go to great lengths to avoid social judgment by others and protect their social identity, endangering their health, engaging in risky behavior, and avoiding medical care even when major health problems are present (Helweg-Larsen & Collins, 1994; Kiefe et al., 1998) . Research findings suggest that having to shop for a sensitive product that others may not approve of can be perceived as a threat to social identity, provoking feelings of social judgment when others are present. When making an embarrassing purchase, consumers visit less-crowded stores, avoid asking employees for help, and wait for other customers to leave the aisle (Blair & Roese, 2013) . More recently, consumers have started to shop online for items such as dieting products or plus-size clothing and to opt for using self-service checkout systems when, for example, purchasing condoms (Krishna et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2014) . However, online purchases and self-service checkouts can pose difficulties through technological complexity or temporal issues (i.e., the product not being immediately accessible via the internet) (Miyazaki & Fernandez, 2001; Young et al., 2017) . In addition, use of self-serving technologies and online retailers may raise legal, ethical, and safety issues, as when buying medications in pharmacies (Fung et al., 2004) . Importantly, these strategies do not work when the source of embarrassment lies in social interaction between a frontline employee and a customer (Miller & Leary, 1992) . While consumers can at least mentally prepare themselves when having to acquire an embarrassing product, interactional situations often occur unexpectedly, such as when a service employee criticizes customers or confronts them with their own errors (Grace, 2007 (Grace, , 2009 .",

In these situations, the automated service interaction may reduce a consumer's apprehension of social judgment (Higuchi & Fukada, 2002) , a prediction in line with a study showing that a robot reduces feelings of embarrassment (Pitardi et al., 2021) . This reduction should make it easier to face a situation such as acquiring embarrassing products or facing criticism by a frontline employee.

Study 1, a laboratory study, shows that when having to acquire an embarrassing product through an in-person encounter with a human or an encounter with a robot service provider, consumers prefer the robot over the human service provider. 1 Study 2, a field study, comprises a real advertising campaign on Facebook which shows that users are more likely to click on an ad promoting an embarrassing service when the ad features a robot rather than a human service provider. 2 Studies 3-5 were conducted online through the platform Prolific. 3 Study 3 shows that consumers are more likely to accept an alternative offering from a robot (vs. human) when confronted with their own error. Study 4 sheds light on the underlying process and establishes that consumers feel less socially judged by a robot and therefore are more likely to acquire an embarrassing product in a pharmacy. Study 5 empirically tests a third hypothesis on the role of robot anthropomorphism. We show that consumers feel less judged by a machine-like robot than by a highly human-like robot, owing to differences in perceived automated social presence, affecting the likelihood the consumer will acquire an embarrassing product. Illustrative photos of the service providers used across the studies appear in Fig. 1 .

A sensitivity power analysis in G*Power (v3.1; Faul et al., 2009) indicated that this sample size provided 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect (w = 0.28) for the difference between conditions. 2 We determined the number of Facebook users on the basis of an estimated test power of 80% (Mookerjee et al., 2021) . 3 A priori power analysis using G*Power (power of 0.80 and an alpha error probability of 0.05) yielded a minimum sample of 351 to detect a small to medium-sized two-way interaction effect (f = 0.15) between service provider and embarrassment. Given that we excluded participants who failed our attention checks (regarding human vs. robot service provider and the situation/ product that was described), we overrecruited by about 15% and requested samples of 405 respondents for Studies 3 and 4, but sometimes received more/ fewer responses because participants started the study simultaneously. Given that the differences between robots with varying levels of anthropomorphism are expected to be smaller than differences between a robot and a human, we seek adequate power to detect a small interaction effect (f = 0.10) in Study 5. While the required sample size was 787, financial constraints allowed us to collect only 709 responses. Intentions to acquire the product The intention to acquire an embarrassing product is higher with a machine-like robot (vs. human) and equally high for the highly anthropomorphic robot and human (highly human-like=5.58, machine-like=6.03, human= 5.75; F(2,1065)=27.85, p<0.001).",

However, results showed no difference between the hosts when participants were not allowed to enter because the restaurant was full (M robot = 3.75, M human = 3.89; p = 0.194). When denied entrance by the human host, participants were less likely to dine at the other restaurant when facing a more (vs. less) embarrassing service encounter (M high = 3.50, M low = 3.89; F(1,376) = 12.12, p = 0.001, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.03). This choice was not the case for the service robot (M high = 3.77, M low = 3.75; p = 0.800).",

Similarly, participants put more effort into a negotiation game when they interacted with a physically embodied robotic character than with a disembodied screen character (Bartneck, 2003) .

In particular, we find that a highly human-like robot is perceived as having a higher level of automated social presence, which is strengthened when the consumer is acquiring an embarrassing product (b = 0.80, p < 0.001) compared to a less embarrassing product (b = 0.39, p = 0.006). This perceived automated social presence led to stronger feelings of being socially judged (b = 0.53, p < 0.001), which in turn negatively influenced the intention to acquire the embarrassing product from an anthropomorphic service robot instead of a machine-like service robot (b = \u22120.29, p < 0.001).",

Study 5 finds support for H3 and additionally reveals that the greater perceptions of automated social presence triggered by a highly anthropomorphic robot are strengthened if an embarrassing product is being acquired.

In five studies, including a lab study with actual human-robot interactions and a field study in a real advertising context, we show that when social presence is automated by a service robot, anxiety about social judgment decreases, helping consumers to overcome reluctance to engage in embarrassing situations. Our findings are in line with a recent study showing that robots reduce feelings of embarrassment (Pitardi et al., 2021 ), yet importantly extends that study's results to an array of managerially relevant outcomes, such as the propensity to acquire an embarrassing product or accept an alternative offering from the same service provider. While embarrassing products may be purchased online or via self-checkouts (Krishna et al., 2019; Jackson et al., 2014) , embarrassing social service interactions as featured in our studies can arise unexpectedly, such as when the service provider confronts a customer with her own mistakes (Grace, 2009) .",

Very lifelike robots typically evoke eeriness and negative feelings (Mori et al., 2012) and are experienced as more judgmental because consumers perceive a greater automated social presence. Accordingly, a more technical-looking robot or a robot with only a few human characteristics, such as the robot \"Pepper,\" will be a more prudent option because the overall service experience will be more positive and will likely increase customer satisfaction.",

Second, the generalizability of our results is limited to service encounters with no social entities present other than the service provider. Although as a means of behavioral coping with public embarrassment customers try to be alone or around others who would ignore them (Dahl et al., 2001; Lau-Gesk & Drolet, 2008) , future work could address the effect of the physical environment in which a social entity is present but not involved with the customer in any way, especially as previous literature has indicated that noninteractive social situations can affect the service experience and service satisfaction (Argo et al., 2005; He et al., 2012) .",
