During the pandemic, nurses were working under extreme physical and emotional pressure while dealing with patients' suffering and death, which could further amplify their anxiety and fears (Labrague & De Los Santos, 2020; Lorente, Vera, & Peir\u00f3, 2020) .

Professional burnout is a serious occupational hazard, as burnt-out nurses show lower job commitment, greater probability of medical errors, reduction in work performance, lower job satisfaction, and frequent absenteeism (Duarte et al., 2020; Labrague & De Los Santos, 2020) . If not properly managed, burnout could eventually result in higher turnover rates among frontline nurses (Labrague & De Los Santos, 2020) . Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could exacerbate the global shortage of nurses, as inadequately addressed burnout will lead to increased turnover risks (Jun et al., 2020) . Thus, mitigating the risks of nurses' burnout and turnover, and enhancing their retention, is a matter of critical concern to nursing stakeholders, especially in times of crisis. Enhancing the resilience of nurses and other health practitioners has been gaining prominence. Recently, the National Academy of Medicine launched the \"Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience,\" an initiative to combat the significant increase in burnout and to develop the skill of resilience among healthcare clinicians (National Academy of Medicine, 2019).",

            "text": "Lebanon is a small Eastern Mediterranean country with a population of around seven million individuals including around two million refugees (Trading Economics, 2020; United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2020). The population is served by 16,927 practicing nurses according to the latest statistics from the Order of Nurses in Lebanon (ONL; Order of Nurses in Lebanon, 2020). While the country has witnessed multiple wars and civil unrests over the last few decades, no crises were more critical than those occurring most recently. Since October 2019, the country has been grappling with a public uprising and an economic meltdown that resulted in the downsizing of hospitals, pay cuts, and decreased earning in all sectors of the economy due to currency devaluation (Doherty & Sullivan, 2020) . Amid all this suffering, the deadly explosion at the port of Beirut brought the nation to its knees (Gardner, 2020) . Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in serious damages to the country's already strained healthcare sector and presented major challenges to the health workforce in general, particularly in nurses. The culmination of multiple crises, added to the unprecedented workload and occupational risk precipitated by the pandemic, meant that Lebanese nurses were at a higher risk of burnout and turnover. Under the current circumstances, it is pivotal to assess the psychological health and degree of resilience of nurses, and to provide evidence-based supportive policy and practice recommendations. The purpose of this study was to determine the level of resilience in the nursing workforce and its relationship to perceived COVID-19 risk, burnout, and turnover intention.",

According to 2019 ONL statistics, the sampling frame included around 8,098 registered nurses working in patient care position in hospitals (ONL, 2020). Since there were no previous systematic investigations of the resilience of nurses within the local context, it was not possible for the authors to estimate the effect size based on those studies. Thus, to err on the side of caution, the authors decided to use the maximum possible effect size of 50%. The required sample size was 367 responses for an assumed margin of error of 5%, confidence level of 95%, and a response distribution/effect size of 50%. Responses exceeding the minimum required sample size of 367 were analyzed. Unemployed nurses, those working outside Lebanon, or nurses not working in patient care were excluded from this study. Since the study employed an online survey questionnaire, nurses without a valid email address in the ONL nursing registration database were also excluded.",

The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25; Connor & Davidson, 2003 ) was used to determine the resilience levels of nurses. Permission for use was obtained from the scale's creators. The scale consists of 25 items scored on a 5-point Likert scale with 0 = not true at all and 4 = true nearly all the time (Connor & Davidson, 2003) . In a previous study, the Cronbach alpha value of the scale was calculated as 0.89, showing good reliability and validity scores (Toma, Guetterman, Yaqub, Talaat, & Fetters, 2017) . In the present study, the Cronbach alpha of the CD-RISC-25 scale was 0.923. Burnout was measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) scales (Kristensen, Borritz, Villadsen, & Christensen, 2005) . The CBI is a 19-item survey with three dimensions: (1) personal burnout (six items), (2) work-related burnout (seven items), and (3) client-related burnout (six items). Scores range from 0 to 100 with 0 = never/almost never and 100 = always. Kristensen et al. (2005) calculated the Cronbach alphas for the CBI scales as 0.85-0.87 (Kristensen et al., 2005) , whereas the corresponding values for this study were found to be 0.870 for the CBI-Personal burnout, 0.867 for the CBI-Work related burnout, and 0.786 for the CBI-Client related burnout. The scales were translated into Arabic for this study with the permission of the creators.",

Nurses scored higher on the personal burnout scale (M = 51.46), than on the work-related burnout scale (M = 49.10) and the clientrelated burnout scale (M = 47.49). The proportion of nurses falling into the very high level of burnout (highest quartile) was equivalent to 15.3%, 12.7%, and 10.4% for personal burnout, work-related burnout, and client-related burnout, respectively. Table 3 shows that, amid the extremely difficult circumstances, most nurses (56.9%) indicated that they were either very unlikely or unlikely to quit their job over the next 12 months. Two in five nurses indicated that nothing would make them give up nursing (40.6%). Troublingly, a comparable percentage (38.3%) indicated that they do not want to be a nurse anymore, but their families need their salary. A quarter of the respondents indicated that they are thinking of working outside the country (24.8%). Only a small proportion of nurses indicated that they do not want to be a nurse anymore (5.1%) or that they are thinking of resigning due to the COVID-19 pandemic (3.2%). Concerning perception of risk, most nurses indicated that they are exposed to a moderate level of risk at work (53.9%), while 17.6% indicated exposure to high risk at work. An additional 16.4% had a perception of no or low risk. Table 4 shows the association of sociodemographic and professional characteristics with resilience as derived from simple and multiple logistic regression. The multiple logistic regression results reveal that the difference between the average CD-RISC score of nurses by their gender and degree type was statistically significant (p = .006 for both; Table 5 displays the association between the burnout level, intention to quit, and the perception of risk with resilience in the study population as derived from the simple and adjusted multiple logistic regression. The table reveals an inverse statistically significant relationship between the scores of nurses for both the CBI subscale score and CD-RISC. As the level of nurse burnout increases, their resilience decreases. Multiple logistic regression showed, after adjusting for confounders, nurses who reported high and very high levels of personal burnout had lower odds of being resilient (OR = 0.20; 95% CI [0.07, 0.60]; p = .004) and (OR = 0.12; 95% CI [0.03, 0.435]; p = .001), respectively.

Similarly, high and very high client-related burnout were associated with lower odds of resilience (OR = 0.23; 95% CI [0.08-0.68]; p = .008) and (OR = 0.09; 95% CI [0.03, 0.34]; p < .001); respectively.

            "text": "The present study findings revealed that the surveyed nurses in Lebanon displayed a moderate level of resilience when compared to the frontline nurses caring for COVID-19 patients in other contexts (Connor & Davidson, 2003; K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 & Sis \u00c7elik, 2020; Lin et al., 2020) . Most nurses indicated an intention to stay in their position and indicated a perception of a moderate level of COVID-19 risk at their workplace. Significant determinants of resilience included gender (males were more resilient when compared to females); degree type (master's level and technical nurses were more resilient when compared to Bachelor prepared nurses); degree of personal, work-related, and client-related burnout (nurses with medium and high levels of burnout were less resilient); and intention to quit (those very likely to quit were less resilient compared to the very unlikely to quit). The results showed that frontline nurses had moderate levels of resilience compared to healthcare workers and nurses in other contexts (Duarte et al., 2020; K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 & Sis \u00c7elik, 2020; Lin et al., 2020) . Despite the multiple crises the country was witnessing at the time of the study's data collection, Lebanese nurses had higher resilience levels compared to nurses in Hubei, China (M = 64.86 \u00b1 13.46; Lin et al., 2020) , nurses in Sichuan Province, China (M = 62.16 \u00b1 18.21) , and nurses in Turkey (M = 64.28 \u00b1 15.99; K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 & Sis \u00c7elik, 2020) . This could be partially attributed to the fact that many hospitals at the time of the study were receiving a limited number of COVID-19 patients while working on expanding their capacity. Another explanation for the relatively high resilience levels among Lebanese nurses, as compared to nurses in better resourced settings, relates to the fact that Lebanese nurses are part of the Lebanese societal fabric which was (Ghattas, 2020) . The same societal fabric enhances the role of spirituality in the life of people, especially those working under continued pressure, such as nurses (Doumit, Rahi, Saab, & Majdalani, 2019) . Studies from the Middle East Region showed that nurses' spirituality encompasses all dimensions of personhood, including their professional lives (Weathers, 2018) . In fact, an examination of the various constructs of resilience in this study revealed that the \"spiritual influence\" construct was the highest ranked among the constructs of resilience (Connor & Davidson, 2003) . Furthermore, Lebanon's social fabric and its varied religious composition enhances the role of spirituality in people's lives. Thus, the spirituality of nurses in Lebanon could be another important asset in their ability to cope with the pandemic. The moderate resilience levels may also reflect the moral and financial support that nurses have been receiving since the beginning of the pandemic (Badih, 2020) . Social support helps nurses in achieving positive emotional states, reduces nurses' stress and anxiety levels, and protects both their physical and mental health, and consequently improves their resilience levels K\u0131l\u0131n\u00e7 & Sis \u00c7elik, 2020) . These results highlight the importance of developing interventions to increase the social support provided to nurses during these stressful periods to promote their psychological well-being and resilience.",

            "text": "The study revealed that gender was a statistically significant determinant of resilience among nurses. Specifically, the resilience of female nurses was significantly lower than that of their male counterparts. This could be attributed to the innate differences in coping strategies between (Bezek, 2010; Huang, Xing, & Gamble, 2019) . The root causes for this increased vulnerability could be attributed to cultural aspects since female professionals, especially in the Middle East region, find it very difficult to balance increased workloads and stressors with family and household demands (Chandra, 2012) . As such, female nurses must be provided with more organizational support and flexibility, and should have access to counseling services, especially at times of crisis. Such support promises a good return on investment as it enhances the productivity and retention of nurses at the institution and would eventually lead to an improved patient experience and outcomes (Hart et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2020) . It is yet to be determined whether the gender difference in resilience identified in this study is attributable to innate gender differences in coping strategies and in dealing with crises or if the differences are due to the above-mentioned cultural aspects. Future research should investigate this gender aspect in further details. Resilience in this study was also associated with degree type. Specifically, compared to bachelor prepared nurses, those with a Master of Nursing degree and with a technical degree were significantly more resilient. Literature reports a positive association between resilience and higher educational qualification (Roberts et al., 2020) . While this goes in synch with our findings regarding master-prepared nurses, it does not support the increased resilience of technical degree nurses. One possible explanation, within the Lebanese context, relates to the technical nurses being content with having a job at a time where more educated and experienced nurses are either receiving decreased earning or are being laid off across the country (Reuters Staff, 2020) .",

The authors acknowledge that this is not an all-inclusive list guided by a theoretical framework and recommend that future studies should be guided by a more comprehensive framework. Second, since questionnaires were filled electronically, we cannot exclude the possibility that their responses might have been affected by factors in the survey environment. There is also the possibility that the nurses responded to their global perceptions of resilience and burnout rather than to the wording of the survey items. Third, although an invitation was sent to all nurses and they all had an equal opportunity to participate in this study, we cannot ascertain whether respondents were different than non-respondents on the study variables.
