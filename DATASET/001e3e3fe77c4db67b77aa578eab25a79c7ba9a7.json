Although the existing literature describes key challenges associated with the design and conduct of definitive (evaluation) trials, there is a lack of information concerning specific challenges associated with the intervention development phase and setup of feasibility studies. In particular, the literature is scarce concerning the challenges associated with conducting digital health care research, such as research on internet-administered interventions and research using digital features to support the execution of study procedures (eg, recruitment, consent, retention, and data collection and management).

However, clinical trials are costly and resource-intensive for both researchers and funders [2] , and approximately 85% of research investment is wasted [3] . Examples of research waste include asking the wrong research questions [4] , using inappropriate study designs and methods [5, 6] , poor and biased reporting [7] , and underreporting [8] . There are a number of inefficiencies related to clinical trial conduct that can lead to research waste, especially given that the design and efficient conduct of clinical trials is challenging [9] and operationally complex [10, 11] . Challenges include the creation and management of trial procedures and materials; communication with multiple stakeholders; ethical and regulatory requirements; the recruitment, training, and turnover of trial personnel; budget management; the recruitment and retention of trial participants; and data monitoring and assurance of data quality [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Consequently, there is scarce evidence to inform decisions concerning the management of clinical trials [1] . Furthermore, in contrast to the literature focused on the conduct of definitive (evaluation) trials, there is a lack of literature concerning the challenges of conducting intervention development research and pilot and feasibility studies, following the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for the development and evaluation of complex interventions [15] . Indeed, there is limited guidance on how to design and conduct feasibility studies, leading to poor study design and reporting [16, 17] . Given that many preparatory development [18, 19] and clinical, methodological, and procedural uncertainties require testing [20] before progressing to a definitive trial, development and feasibility phases are substantial works in and of themselves, with findings often underreported [16, 17] .",

The use of digital technologies in health care research has intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic in an attempt to continue health care research in the absence of in-person contact [34] . Digital health care research is associated with reduced trial costs, improved trial efficiency [35, 36] , and recruitment of more diverse populations [25, 34] . As such, the use of digital features to execute health care research is likely to continue to grow beyond the pandemic [34] . However, at present, challenges related to the conduct of digital health care research are less well documented [25, 32] and focus on topics such as patient privacy and confidentiality, adequate infrastructure, data accuracy and integrity, and user acceptability [25, 37, 38] . Some challenges are beginning to be addressed by the development of new ethical and regulatory standards and increased provision of guidance for investigators in the use of digital technologies [25, 37, 38] . However, the literature remains in its infancy, and there is a need for researchers to publish their experiences in conducting digital health care research [25] .",

The analysis of meeting minutes took place between January and May 2020. Meeting minutes were read multiple times by MK to enable familiarization with the data set as a whole. MK identified initial codes across the data set to begin organizing the data. To enhance rigor, initial codes were discussed in weekly meetings with JW. After initial coding across the data set was complete, MK sorted initial codes into initial main themes and subthemes within main themes, with continued weekly discussions with JW to establish initial consensus and refine the main themes and subthemes [61] . Next, the initial thematic map (Figure 1 ) was presented to the research team (HG, JH, JW, KN, LVE, MK, and YHS) for feedback in a face-to-face discussion group held on February 14, 2020 (120 minutes).

A particular challenge was related to occasions in which the entire research team was involved in the decision-making process. Group decision-making resulted in the time taken for the principal investigator or a researcher to make a final decision being longer than was always necessary. A tension was identified concerning the desire to build and maintain a supportive team environment versus the need for research team members with more experience and leadership responsibilities to make quick decisions. This resulted in examples from the meeting minutes of the group decision-making process taking weeks, or sometimes months, before a final decision was made by the principal investigator. Group decision-making was particularly challenging when research team members had different preferences, opinions, and different levels of experience and expertise, resulting in difficulties in reaching a consensus.

For example, multiple recruitment rounds were held to recruit a postdoctoral researcher to work full-time in the study; however, no candidates with the correct expertise were found. In addition, retention of research team personnel (eg, research assistants) was raised as a difficulty, for example, staff turnover was experienced due to short-term temporary contracts and the uncertainty of future employment being tied to study funding. As such, difficulties were experienced needing to replace temporary personnel and provide training to new research team members, taking significant time and further impacting the study time plan. This was especially problematic as it was difficult to recruit research assistants with prior experience of working in similar research environments, and thus the need for training was understandably greater.",

One challenge relates to the time taken by public authorities to make decisions and provide approval. A specific example related to the submission of an ethical amendment to the Swedish Ethical Review Authority regarding the implementation of a study within a trial [58] embedded in the ENGAGE feasibility study. The study within a trial was approved; however, the authority raised concerns regarding previously approved parts of the study design (eg, an opt-out recruitment procedure involving telephone reminders to parents who do not actively decline study participation). Raising concerns regarding a previously approved application was potentially because the Swedish government replaced regional ethical review boards with a single national review authority during the study setup phase, meaning applications and requests for amendment were no longer necessarily reviewed by the same local authority. This resulted in additional delays, with the research team needing to respond to the authority to further justify the use of an opt-out procedure. Additional delays were experienced by external companies and contractors, for example, not working at full capacity during the summer of 2019 (eg, taking a summer vacation). Another delay related to external factors was experienced when Uppsala University upgraded their servers, resulting in members of the Portal team being allocated to mitigate risks to the Portal during the upgrade and thus unable to prioritize technical requirements for the study and intervention.",

For example, during the intervention development phase, multiple changes and continued improvements were made to the intervention content, language, and overall design (eg, font, color palette, logo design, professional illustrations, and layout). However, any change to language and design had a subsequent impact on other study components, for example, participant information sheets. It was perceived that there were many interrelated moving parts and any detail changed in the intervention or feasibility study resulted in a snow-ball effect on multiple other intervention and study components. A further example relates to study documentation. While refining the intervention, specific study terminology was still under development, for example, intervention name, e-therapists being referred to in the study as parent guides, the structure of the intervention, module, and chapter titles. During the feasibility study setup phase, study documentation was under development (eg, case report forms, data management, SMS text message and email reminder protocols and reminder content, standard operating procedures, and the study handbook). However, each terminology change resulted in revisions to all study documentation. Another example related to the study information video, which had to be rerecorded after numerous changes were made to the study information sheets based on changes to terminology used in the intervention. Research team members raised that these challenges seemed related to setting up a feasibility study when the intervention had not yet been finalized. The research team needed to be flexible and adaptable during this process and keep track of any detail and subsequent impact on other elements of the intervention and feasibility study.",

For example, given the aforementioned challenges with delays in intervention development, meeting minutes documented difficulties scheduling specific events, such as training e-therapists, or presenting the intervention to PRPs for feedback. On several occasions, e-therapist training was rescheduled due to delays in intervention development; for example, finalizing the written intervention material and some technical features, such as videoconferencing, taking longer than initially anticipated to develop and test. Furthermore, time for task completion was often underestimated, which was discussed at times as being related to expertise. This could be observed by how several research team personnel had no prior experience of working within a similar research environment, resulting in some tasks taking longer than anticipated. Planning and scheduling were also described as generally difficult given the interrelatedness of intervention development and feasibility study setup tasks. For example, any changes made to the intervention affected the entire planning chain.",

However, the Portal team used Atlassian Jira Software Server Version 8.5.1, a software development tool used by agile teams to plan, track, and release software features. At times, this was experienced as a challenge as while the research team tracked overall technical feature development in the Gantt chart, this was at times out of sync with more detailed software development planning in Jira Software Server. During the study setup phase, the developer team began to report updates to the research assistant responsible for the Gantt chart each week, which improved planning. However, research team members discussed how a more integrated solution may have facilitated scheduling and planning, especially because of the detail and complexity involved in the development of new digital features for both the intervention and support study execution.",

[23, 25, 37, 38] One interesting challenge was identified in relation to the group decision-making process affecting the study timeframe. Research concerning cultural expectations and decision-making indicates that, within the Swedish culture, there are high expectations for shared authority and decision-making between managers and personnel [64] . Generally, the workplace is less hierarchical with decisions and responsibilities shared and decisions made in larger groups [65] . However, research suggests that more unilateral or directive decision-making may be required when there are significant time pressures and critical deadlines and with more novice team members [74] . While adopting group decision-making processes may help to maintain good relationships and is more in line with cultural expectations, this was at tension with the need for more unilateral and directive decision-making, given the time critical nature of the research. Indeed, one reason for failing clinical trials may pertain to a lack of structured business-like trial management [12] .",

However, competent trial management by a dedicated trial manager responsible for day-to-day operations is essential for efficient trial conduct. Indeed, once funding is awarded, the trial manager, rather than the principal investigator and coinvestigators, has been suggested to be the most important research team member to successfully deliver a clinical trial [75] .

To the best of our knowledge, there is no specific trial management professional career structure within academic settings in Sweden, which may account for some of the difficulties recruiting a postdoctoral researcher with the required competencies. An added complexity in the Swedish context is the employment projection law (LAS \u00a7 5a 1982:80), which stipulates that personnel can be employed on a fixed-term contract for a maximum of 2 years and must be offered a permanent position thereafter to remain in employment. However, given the time-limited nature of health care research and uncertainty concerning continued funding, this often results in research personnel only being employed for a maximum 2-year fixed-term contract. Subsequently, it is difficult to maintain experienced research staff for the duration of the trial funding periods. However, even in countries such as the United Kingdom, where trial management is more established within academic settings, barriers are experienced, such as a lack of clarity around career structures, progression, and professional status, lack of training opportunities, lack of professional accreditation, and staff retention due to lack of funding and instability of short-term contracts [11, 12, 79] .",

In the present context, a number of challenges were related to the interrelatedness of the intervention and subsequent feasibility study, for example, further development, refinement, and adaptation of the intervention resulted in multiple changes to associated documentation for the feasibility study.

            "text": "In addition, while a significant phased approach to intervention development had already taken place [41, 42, 49, 54] , a structured approach was not adopted regarding the technical development of the intervention. Given the complexity of the development of internet-administered interventions [80, 81] , it may have been beneficial to adopt a specific development model designed to inform the development of health care interventions using internet-based technologies, such as the Behavioral Intervention Technology model [82] . Adopting a more structured approach to technical development may have facilitated the communication of technical requirements to the Portal team. Indeed, challenges relating to communication between the research and Portal team may have been experienced, given that requirements were requested from those unfamiliar with software programming, and software developers are unfamiliar with research methodologies and LICBT interventions [23] . The Portal team adopts agile software development, therefore working with software requirements in short iterations [83] with a need for frequent, quick, and short-term decisions [84] . However, this approach can cause challenges when there is a need for collaborative decision-making with multiple stakeholders with varying backgrounds, expertise, and goals [66] . Barriers to efficient communication and development of shared knowledge may be related to a lack of understanding of each other's field (eg, different educational backgrounds, technical knowledge, and experience), difficulties with clients describing functional requirements, and difficulties with software developers communicating time expectations with clients in a direct manner [68] . A lack of shared understanding between software development teams and end-clients can result in unrealistic planning and frequent changes in planning [66] . In addition, transforming study procedures normally conducted in-person to digital form is a complex procedure requiring significant planning, time, and expertise [25, 36] . However, involving a member of the Portal team in the weekly research team meetings significantly improved the development of shared knowledge and understanding and helped to overcome some of the aforementioned challenges. Indeed, more active engagement between software developers and the end client has been posited as a helpful strategy to facilitate communication [68] .",

Health care interventions delivered by digital technologies have evolved rapidly over the past two decades [85] . However, this also means that technology becomes quickly outdated [86] , given the technological advancements and changing end-user expectations. However, rapid technical evolution is not easily compatible with traditional research approaches such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [85] , and translating traditional clinical trial procedures to digital form may require the complete re-engineering of trial design and processes [36] . The Portal was developed to support traditional health care research, for example, RCTs and observational studies, and multiple RCTs of internet-administered cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have been conducted on the Portal [87] [88] [89] [90] . The Portal was originally designed to deliver two internet-administered cognitive behavioral therapy interventions [87, 88] ; however, over time, the Portal has been developed to support the needs of different studies and has experienced a continuous flow of technical requirements from researchers since its conception in 2010 [22, 23] . However, the time taken to design and conduct traditional health care research is not in line with fast-paced technical advances [91] . Therefore, when using digital technologies for intervention delivery and the execution of study procedures, careful planning is required as technology may change [25, 32] . Multiple requests for new digital features and changes to existing features were required for both the intervention and the execution of study procedures; however, challenges were experienced relating to the legacy software architecture of the Portal. For example, new feature requests or changes to existing features can result in unanticipated negative impacts on existing features used by ongoing studies. This highlights a key challenge for research environments using internet-based technologies, especially in a context where new digital features and complex configurations are added over time [23] . Appropriate technical infrastructure (eg, having the appropriate hardware, software, and technical expertise) has been highlighted as a significant challenge in conducting successful digital health care research [38] .",

An additional limitation relates to selectivity bias [60] , and it is difficult to separate the analysis from the context of the research team, for example, biases and opinions held by research team members.

Furthermore, preliminary posttreatment follow-up data indicated that retention targets were successfully met. While delays to study start were experienced, taking a careful and detail-orientated approach to intervention development and feasibility study setup may have helped facilitate meeting recruitment and retention targets and will hopefully enhance efficiencies across subsequent phases of our planned research, for example, a definitive (evaluation) trial.",

A prevalent example concerned communication between researchers and the Portal development team. For example, during the development of the intervention and digital features to support study execution, the research team had many technical requirements. However, sometimes, there was a mismatch between researchers and the Portal development team in their understanding of technical requirements (eg, how interactive homework exercises were presented on the Portal). Furthermore, difficulties were identified concerning time estimation and subsequent planning. For example, the Portal team at times underestimated the length of time to deliver a technical requirement, or technical requirements were changed by the research team, subsequently impacting the study time plan. In addition, researchers sometimes held unrealistic expectations concerning delivery time for a new requirement, negatively impacting the study time plan. Difficulties with communication were more prevalent in the study setup phase. During the study setup phase, a software developer from the Portal team began to attend research team meetings, helping to avoid misunderstanding and clarifying requirements.",
