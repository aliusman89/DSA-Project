We first study the case where the pre-change distribution is known, and then study the extension where only the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution are known. In both cases, no knowledge of the post-change distribution is assumed other than that it has bounded support. For the case where the pre-change distribution is known, we derive a test that asymptotically minimizes the worst-case detection delay over all post-change distributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. We then study the limiting form of the optimal test as the gap between the pre-and post-change means goes to zero, which we call the Mean-Change Test (MCT). We show that the MCT can be designed with only knowledge of the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution. We validate our analysis through numerical results for detecting a change in the mean of a beta distribution. We also demonstrate the use of the MCT for pandemic monitoring.",

Given a stochastic sequence whose distribution changes at some unknown change-point, the goal is to detect the change after it occurs as quickly as possible, subject to false alarm constraints. The QCD framework has had a wide range of applications, including but not limited to line-outage in power systems [1] , dim-target manoeuvre detection [2] , stochastic process control [3] , structural health monitoring [4] , and, more recently, in the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problem with piece-wise stationary bandits [5] . Two formulations are used in the classical QCD problem: the Bayesian formulation [6] , where the changepoint is assumed to follow some prior distribution, and the minimax formulation [7] , [8] , where the worst-case detection delay is minimized over all possible change-points, subject to false alarm constraints. In both the Bayesian and minimax settings, if the pre-and post-change distributions are known, This work was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant ECCS-2033900, and by the Army Research Laboratory under Cooperative Agreement W911NF-17-2-0196, through the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. low-complexity efficient solutions to the QCD problem can be found [9] .",

Although it is reasonable to assume that we can obtain a large amount of data in the pre-change regime, this may not be the case for the post-change regime. In applications such as the epidemic detection problem and the MAB problem, a change in a specific statistic (e.g., the mean) of the distribution is of interest. This is different from the original QCD problem where any distributional change needs to be detected. Furthermore, in many applications, the support of the distribution is bounded. For example, the observations representing the fraction of some specific group in the entire population are bounded between 0 and 1. This is the case, for example, in the pandemic monitoring problem that we discuss in detail in Section IV.",

            "text": "There have been a number of lines of work on the QCD problem when the pre-and/or post-change distributions are not completely known. The most prevalent is the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) approach, in which the maximum of the test statistics corresponding to each possible changepoints is used to construct the test. A GLR approach for a Gaussian mean-change detection problem is proposed in [10] . A GLR test for the case where the pre-and post-change distributions come from one-parameter exponential families is analyzed in [11] . A kernel approach to construct GLR statistics is discussed in [12] . More recently, a GLR meanchange test for sub-Gaussian observations using scan statistics is proposed and analyzed in [13] , and this approach is applied to the MAB problem in [5] . In all of these methods, the complexity of computing the test statistic at each time-step grows at least linearly with the number of samples. In practice, a windowed version of the GLR test statistic is used to keep the complexity small, while suffering some loss in performance. An alternative to the GLR approach was given in [14] , where a histogram is used to estimate the post-change distribution, and a low complexity test with a recursive structure is constructed.",

We set the mean-threshold \u03b7 to be a multiple of the prechange mean, with understanding that such a threshold might be indicative of a new wave. With this choice, we observe that the MCT statistic significantly and persistently crosses the testthreshold around late November in all counties, which is strong indication of a new wave of the pandemic. More importantly, unlike the raw observations which are highly varying, the MCT statistic shows a clear dichotomy between the pre-and postchange settings, with the statistic staying near zero before the purported onset of the new wave, and taking off nearly vertically after the onset.",
