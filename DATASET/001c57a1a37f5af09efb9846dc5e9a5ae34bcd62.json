            "text": "In recent times, social prescribing has been introduced in some countries, and substantially in the U.K. The objective of this scheme is to offer non-medical care mainly to primary care patients. Although the idea of this scheme is not new, its formalization is. Using a narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed and gray literature, this article discusses the social prescribing scheme, some of its compelling aspects and challenges in offering non-medical care, particularly regarding referrals being made from primary care settings. The social prescribing scheme has several impelling forces that include its potential to turn primary care to primary healthcare, tackle social determinants of health and social needs, improve wellbeing and physical health, offer person-centered care, strengthen preventive care, and bridge healthcare organizations with the third sector. This scheme also faces several challenges including service standards and boundaries, sustainability, availability of appropriate services, low engagement of clients and insufficient evidence. While this scheme lacks validated evidence, it is theoretically compelling. Given that the demand for non-medical care is growing in most societies and that the usefulness of non-medical care is gaining prominence, social prescribing is likely to continue to proliferate.",

Supporting people whose health problems are exacerbated by non-medical issues is a challenge for the healthcare system. However, the willingness and ability of healthcare professionals to take patients' daily lives and concerns into account are seen as key element of good quality medical care (3) . Indeed, primary care patients may not be able to differentiate between medical and non-medical problems, since these are often intricately connected (4) , while primary care workers may not be equipped to handle such problems (also termed as social problems) (5) . As a result, patients may assess overall care as being inadequate and feel dissatisfied. Growing demand for holistic support, including non-medical care, has recently prompted the emergence of social prescribing initiatives in diverse national contexts.",

The King's Fund (8) defines it as a mechanism for enabling primary care professionals to refer people to nonclinical services in their local areas. The CentreForum Mental Health Commission broadens the definition to include the mechanism of linking patients to social services regardless of the sources of the referrals (9) . Therefore, social prescribing is a non-medical referral option for GPs, for other medical and some non-medical professionals and also for self-referral to the sources of support.",

These factors are beyond the service scope of healthcare professionals, but account for more than half of the determinants of health and wellbeing. The social prescribing effort is, in fact, the formalization of the process, as many healthcare professionals have already been undertaking similar activities although informally or somewhat on ad hoc basis. Although people can find and access non-medical services independently, a formal referral (i.e., officially sending or directing patients) brings importance to the referred-services and gives it the credibility afforded to health professionals. Formal referrals underline the \"health value\" of the service and legitimize the problems and their importance (14, 15) . Furthermore, referrals help patients to be \"transferred\" from healthcare settings to appropriate services/resources (16) . Also, without formal structures, patients may not use their referrals (5).",

There are no clear standards about the skillset of linkworkers. Although a recent document discusses the common attributes of a good scheme and job description of linkworkers, these attributes are yet to be evaluated (61) . There are concerns regarding service standards and confidentiality in the third sector, in comparison with the mainstream health sector (15) . Also, there is lack of clarity in service-boundaries (62) . For instance, it is unclear as to who should manage the link-workers -healthcare professionals or the third sector (10) . Similarly, whether patients' medical history should be transferred to community services, if deemed necessary, or left to patients' discretion is also unclear (63) . An academic set-up with accreditation and continuing professional development may alleviate these unclarities and give professional recognition to those working in social prescribing (7). Having professional standards is also essential for quality assurance. The facilities in the third sector vary substantiallysuch as self-help groups, charitable trusts and community interest companies-and so do their governance structures (19) . The standards that exist in the voluntary sector may not be appropriate for social prescribing, and thus health professionals may not feel confident about the governance and professional standards of link-workers and facilities providing the services and safety of the patients (19) . A clear line of accountability is needed at every stage of the social prescribing process and between the organizations and providers involved.",

Second, funding for these schemes is often non-recurrent, putting them at risk of ending abruptly. Funding reductions due to austerity measures and COVID-19 may further stretch the sustainability. Third, link-workers in many schemes are volunteers. There is a demand for a paid role with a pathway to career progression (66) , which warrants additional funding. Fourth, to achieve a tangible benefit, clients need to be supported for an appropriate period (5, 16) , which may increase further pressure on this sector. Indeed, some VCSE organizations already have significant commitments and may not have capacity to meet the additional demand created through social prescribing (67) . Therefore, the sustainability is a looming question. However, the third sector is believed to have capacity to accommodate the demand of social prescribing, regardless of its volume (68) .

Patients expect healthcare professionals to perform an investigation, refer to a diagnostic center, and or write a prescription for a drug, not make a referral to social prescribing. Also, social prescribing does not prescribe the solution, but provides an atmosphere for patients to work on their plan of action. Moreover, it may take time to produce a tangible benefit.
