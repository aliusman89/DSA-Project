In some conditions, this is considered to be a key element (vg demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) [1] ), while in others play a secondary role as an adjunct to other mechanisms (vg neurodegenerative diseases [2, 3] , or other diseases of a genetic or structural basis [4] ). The evidence of this transversal involvement of neuro-inflammation and/or immunity in the pathogenic processes of neurological conditions is constantly increasing thanks to major advances in basic research, and epilepsy does not escape from this paradigm.",

It is incontrovertible that certain inflammatorybased pathological conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing epileptic seizures. Indeed, in most autoimmune diseases, there is a five-fold increased risk of epilepsy in children and a four-fold increased risk in non-elderly adults (aged < 65) [6] . Classic epidemiological studies labeled a large percentage of epilepsies as idiopathic or of unknown origin [7] . However, nowadays, a significant subgroup of these epilepsies is known to have an immune-mediated origin, to the point that the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification, in its latest update, recognizes immune-mediated epilepsy as one specific etiological category [8] .",

The target antigens of these antibodies basically include intracellular proteins (cytoplasmic or nuclear enzymes and proteins that act as RNA ligands) and membrane proteins (ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors) [15] .

In addition, native CD4+ T cells are the starting point for the transition toward a specific immune response of the adaptive system, and depending on the inflammatory molecules found in their microenvironment, they can further polarize into various cell lines: Differentiation in either cell line is determined by molecular factors produced by antigen-presenting cells and B cells [18, 19] .",

This signal can be activated by ligands associated with infections (PAMPS) or by endogenous molecules, such as proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1beta) or DAMPS (e.g., high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)) [59] . The activation of the IL-1\u03b2/IL-1\u03b2 R axis is strictly linked to the secretion of the intracellular protein MyD88 after the activation of innate immune receptors (especially TLR) during pathogen recognition [31] . This activates an intracellular molecular cascade that, ultimately, can lead to an alteration of neuronal excitability. \u2022 TNF-\u03b1: TNF-\u03b1 affects seizure susceptibility in animal models in a dual pattern. The mechanism of action seems to be exerted through receptors TNFR1 (p55) or TNFR2 (p75) receptor signaling [60] . In general, TNFR1 has been reported to mediate the ictogenic effects of TNF-\u03b1, whereas TNFR2 mediates the neuroprotective actions of this cytokine. \u2022 High-Mobility Proteins (HMGB1): These molecules are components of chromatin and are passively released from necrotic cells and actively released by cells that are exposed to deep stress [61] . Recent studies have described models of epilepsy induced by bicuculline and kainic acid that highlight the nature of HMGB1-TLR4 interactions [62] , as well as its role in epileptic recurrence, emphasizing the role of immune-related molecules in epileptogenesis [63] . \u2022 Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2): COX-2 is an enzyme synthesizing prostaglandin (PGs) that has also received attention due to its possible involvement in seizure generation [64] . It seems that the presence of COX-2 facilitates the recurrence of seizures in the hippocampus and may upregulate P-Glycoprotein at the BBB, causing AED resistance [65] .",

Among them, perhaps the most promising is resveratrol [115] . \u2022 HMGB1 inhibitor drugs: Emerging evidence suggest that HMGB1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy [62] since glycyrrhizin, an HMGB1 inhibitor, exhibits neuroprotective and antiepileptic effects in different animal models of epilepsy [116, 118] . However, this drug has not been assessed in clinical trials for epilepsy. \u2022 TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor drugs: There are four TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors approved as treatments for ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn's disease: infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol [98] . The mechanism of action is based on both the neutralization of TNF-\u03b1 bioactivity and the induction of apoptosis of TNF-expressing mononuclear cells [99] . Adalimumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to TNF-\u03b1, which showed to be reduced seizures and functional impairment in patients with RE [100] . Indeed, there is an ongoing clinical trial trying to evaluate the benefit of adalimumab in patients with RE. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04003922). In addition, infliximab was effective in a patient with relapsing polychondritis and LE [101] . Conversely, golimumab and certolizumab have not been tested for epilepsy. \u2022 Drugs modulating T lymphocytes: A large experience has been gathered about these drugs regarding efficacy and safety due to their use as disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis. \u2022 Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-\u03b14-integrin antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Integrins are heterodimeric proteins expressed on the cell surface of leukocytes that participate in a wide variety of functions, such as survival, growth, differentiation, migration, inflammatory responses, and tumor invasion, among others [126] . Natalizumab interferes with leukocyte migration across the BBB, which is mediated by interaction between \u03b14-integrin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, resulting in a selective CNS immunosuppression due to lower recruitment of immune cells in the cerebral parenchyma [127] . The administration of anti-\u03b14integrin antibodies showed to reduce seizures in a mouse model of epilepsy [128] .",

            "text": "However, a recent phase II clinical trial in refractory epilepsy did not meet the primary endpoint of decreasing seizures, although no adverse events were reported [102] . Further exploration of possible anti-inflammatory therapies for drug-resistant epilepsy is warranted [103] . Interestingly, some cases of RE have been successfully treated with natalizumab [104] . \u2022 Inebilizumab: this drug is a promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody against the B-cell surface antigen CD19 that has recently been shown to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, another antibody-mediated disorder of the CNS [105] . Compared to rituximab, inebilizumab not only depletes CD20+ B cells but also CD20-plasmablasts and plasma cells, resulting in robust and sustained suppression of humoral immunity. There is an ongoing clinical trial phase II with inebilizumab for the treatment of limbic encephalitis with anti-NMDAR antibodies (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04372615). \u2022 Cytokine-targeted therapies: Given the central role of cytokines in many epileptic disorders, these therapies are promising for patients with epilepsy [109] . Among them, we mainly distinguish anti-interleukin drugs (anakinra and tocilizumab) and anti-interferon-\u03b3 drugs (situximab and emapalumab). \u2022 Anakinra, an anti-IL1 receptor, has shown antiepileptic properties in patients with super refractory epileptic status [110] , RE [111] , and especially in cases of febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), for which it has been proposed as a firstline therapeutic alternative [112, 113] . Additionally, anakinra has been shown to reduce seizures in animal models of anti-NMDAR encephalitis and lithium-pilocarpineinduced epilepsy. \u2022 Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 receptor, has been reported to be effective in FIRES refractory to anakinra [129] . Currently, there are no research reports with situximab or emapalumab for epilepsy. \u2022 Anti-neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) therapies: A novel treatment approach targets the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) of several immune cells. The primary function of FcRn is to prevent IgG and albumin from lysosomal degradation through the recycling and transcytosis of IgG, therefore, prolonging its half-life. Antagonism of this receptor causes IgG catabolism, resulting in reduced overall IgG and pathogenic autoantibody levels [106, 107] . There is currently an ongoing phase II clinical trial with rozanolixizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04875975), a high-affinity human neonatal FC receptor (IgG4P) monoclonal antibody (IgG4P), developed to reduce pathogenic IgG in autoimmune and alloimmune diseases, such as encephalitis with anti-LGI1 antibodies. \u2022 Proteasome inhibitors: Drugs targeting long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs) are a promising treatment for antibody-mediated neurological conditions. Specifically, bortezomid is a selective inhibitor of the S26 protasome for which a possible efficacy has been suggested for the treatment of limbic encephalitis with anti-NMDA antibodies. A recent systematic review shows that more than 50% of the patients reported in the literature treated in this way showed improvement. In any case, specifically designed studies are necessary to evaluate this topic [114] . \u2022 Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK-STAT) Inhibitors: Inhibitors of the JAK-STAT pathway are proposed as a future therapeutic target in neuroinflammatory-based processes since they modulate the intracellular signaling pathways of multiple cytokine receptors [120] . Among these molecules, we find AZD1480, tofacitinib, baricitinib, SAR317461, momelotinib, filgotinib, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, lestaurtinib, or pacritinib [130] , although lestaurtinib has any promising studies on animal models of epilepsy [119] . \u2022 NF-\u03ba\u03b2 inhibitors: As mentioned before, steroids preferentially and indirectly act on the NF-\u03ba\u03b2 transcription complex, although other novel drugs may selectively block this relevant pathway of neuroinflammation. Among them, dimethyl-fumarate, fingolimod, or teriflunamide have been widely used in patients with multiple scle-rosis [131] . Interestingly, promising results have been reported on animal models of epilepsy treated with dimethyl-fumarate and fingolimod [122, 123] . Emerging experimental findings suggest that fingolimod exerts disease-modifying antiepileptic effects based on its anti-neuroinflammatory properties, potent neuroprotection, anti-gliotic effects, myelin protection, reduction in the mTOR signaling pathway, and activation of microglia and astrocytes. Thus, the antiepileptic efficacy of this drug seems to be supported by various mechanisms of action that converge on the modulation of innate brain immunity [117, 122] . \u2022 MAPK pathway inhibitors: Several drugs perform a selective blockade of this pathway, such as SB203580 [121] , macranthoin G, and PD-0325901 (a derivative of CI-1040).",

Several drugs have shown that they can inhibit or modulate the molecular pathways of these immune mechanisms. However, while some therapies such as everolimus have already demonstrated antiepileptic activity in humans, most novel therapies have only suggested their ability to improve seizures in in vitro or animal models, and further studies should assess their potential as antiepileptic drugs.",

In this sense, a two-way relationship exists between epilepsy and depression and anxiety disorders [138] , suggesting a common basis. From this perspective, it is not excluded that the search for new therapeutic strategies that act on the basic mechanisms of epilepsy also influence these comorbidities.",
