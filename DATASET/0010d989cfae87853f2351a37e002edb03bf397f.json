Cases of post-infectious transverse myelitis (TM) and para-infectious TM associated with COVID-19 have been published, and longitudinally extensive 3, 4 , acute necrotizing 5 , and multifocal TM cases have also been reported 6 . Other viral pathogens that can be causative of TM include herpes simplex, Epstein-Barr, varicella-zoster, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya viruses 7 . Flaviviruses (yellow fever, tick-borne encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, dengue, and Zika viruses) and coronaviruses (Middle East respiratory syndrome, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses) are RNA based respiratory viruses with neurotropic properties that allow them to bypass or alter the immune mechanisms, which can lead to viral-induced neurological manifestations. 8 The host-virus interaction triggers the immune mechanisms, and genetics may play an important role too. Therefore, it is interesting that only some individuals develop neurological manifestations after infection with potentially neurotropic pathogens.",

            "text": "About 30%-60% of idiopathic TM cases are preceded by a gastrointestinal, respiratory, or systemic disease. The onset of infectious myelitis symptoms is typically hours to days, but can be months to years after infection, as seen with human T cell lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) associated myelopathy. 9 Several mechanisms are involved in TM's microbial pathogenesis: bystander effects, molecular mimicry, immune complex deposition, and microbial super-antigen mediated inflammation and humoral response. 10 In bystander effects, the pathogen directly invades the CSF or causes indirect damage through an immune-mediated process, as can happen in para-infectious TM. Molecular mimicry is when there J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f is antigenic similarity between pathogen antigens and the human tissue. 10 Molecular mimicry and immune complex deposition have been elucidated as one of the immunopathogenic processes involved in Mycoplasma pneumoniae post-infectious TM. Another interesting mechanism is the activation of lymphocytes by microbial superantigens that can initiate immunopathogenesis and lead to autoimmune diseases. 11 This has been reported in association with COVID-19 in a 15-year old male patient who was diagnosed with anti-MOG IgG associated bilateral optic neuritis a few weeks after COVID-19 illness. 12 The interesting feature in that case was the patient's normal MRI scans (1.5 tesla magnet) on at least 2 occasions, which was a misleading factor that delayed immunotherapy. MRI-negative myelitis is reported to be associated with anti-MOG autoantibodies, 13 and our patient tested negative for the MOG-IgG antibody. Her repeat MRI scans performed on 3-tesla magnet showed multifocal myelitis affecting the cervical cord. High T2 signal intensity involving the bilateral cortical spinal tracts affecting the posterior limbs of internal capsules extending to the cerebral peduncles, and faintly extending to the pons without associated enhancement. These results raise concern for possible Wallerian degeneration, as the patient did not manifest any features of encephalitis or cranial neuropathies from the brainstem involvement throughout her disease course. We speculate that these results indicate an intense axonal degeneration without demyelination that can be seen in severe viral-induced pathogenesis and therefore was not seen on the MRI scan earlier in our patient's disease course. Pathological processes that extensively affect the corticospinal tracts could raise a concern for rapidly progressive motor neuron disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. But our patient's history of ascending sensory paresthesia followed by motor weakness and negative EMG on 2 occasions does not support the diagnosis of motor neuron disease.",

SARS-CoV-1 studies have shown that viral replication can delay the self-reactive T-cell suppression, leading to central nervous system neuroinflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage. 15, 16 Our patient's case highlights several interesting aspects of post-COVID-19 myelitis, including late manifestation of myelitis months after the viral illness, rapidly progressive disease, and MRInegative spinal imaging at the onset of disease that led to diagnostic uncertainty, which dissuaded early initiation of immunotherapy. This atypical presentation of myelitis raises concern for a slow or delayed immune-mediated pathogenesis that happened in response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or its antibodies. ",

Myeloneuropathy laboratory results such as copper, B12, zinc, and lead levels were checked and were within the reference range. Autoimmune laboratory tests were mostly negative except for positive antinuclear antibodies (1:320 speckled), rheumatoid factor 45 IU/ml (<14IU/ml), and cardiolipin antibody IgM 14.1 MPL (<12.5 MPL). The patient had no clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis. Infectious testing for Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, and HTLV I/II were all negative (supplementary table). Given negative neuroimaging, outpatient neurology follow-up and electromyography (EMG) was recommended to evaluate peripheral nervous system diseases. She tested negative for serum aquaporin-4 IgG and MOG-IgG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) antibodies.

On neurological examination, she showed increased tone in her lower extremities and was paraplegic with 3/5 strength on knee extension. Upper extremity proximal strength was normal 5/5 with deltoid, triceps, and biceps muscles. However, distally, she had mild weakness4/5 with finger extension, flexion, and abduction. She had pathologically brisk reflexes in the upper and lower extremities, with positive Hoffman's sign, finger flexors signs bilaterally, and nonsustained clonus at the ankles. Plantar responses were equivocal. She had diminished sensation to light touch and pinprick up to the groin, reduced vibratory sensation to 3 seconds up to knees with absent position sense distally in her toes. She manifested features of complete myelitis. SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mycoplasma IgG antibody tests both were positive. The patient had repeat MRI of brain, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine with and without contrast done on 3 Tesla machines. Brain MRI showed high T2 signal intensity on fluid attenuated inverted recovery sequence (FLAIR) involving the bilateral cortical spinal tracts affecting the posterior limbs of internal capsules extending to the cerebral peduncles and faintly extending to the pons without associated enhancement (Figure F-G). MRI of the cervical spine revealed multifocal signal abnormality present on sagittal FLAIR images of the cervical cord, from skull base to C2-C3, C3-C4, and C5-C6. There was no abnormal intramedullary or leptomeningeal enhancement. (Figure H-J). There was no evidence for edema, expansion, or volume loss within the cervical. MRI of thoracic spine was normal.",
