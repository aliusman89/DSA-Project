He had flu-like symptoms including fever, fatigue, sore throat, cough, headache, and generalized body pain for 4 days; however, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 from a nasopharyngeal swab was negative. The patient was advised to home-quarantine and use conservative treatment. On day 4 after he started showing these symptoms, his medical condition deteriorated and he presented to the emergency department with progressive shortness of breath and palpitations (day 1). On arrival the patient had tachycardia (pulse rate 110/min), tachypnea (respiratory rate 24/min), and fever (temperature 37.8 \u00b0C). He was oriented and awake, but was dehydrated (dry mouth and tongue) and hypoxemic (O2 saturation 89), requiring 4-6 L/min of supplemental oxygen via cannula. The patient underwent chest computed tomography (CT) which revealed radiologic signs typical of Covid-19, including extensive areas of ground-glass opacities involving >90% of the lung parenchyma. Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis (16,400 cells/mL) with marked neutropenia (80%). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (56 mg/dL) and C-reactive protein (43 mg/dL) were both increased.

Immune system tests were done, including human immunodeficiency virus antibody serology, complement and immunoglobulin levels, and flow-cytometric analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations. However, none of them was suggestive of an underlying immunodeficiency disorder. To determine the cause of his low level of platelets, laboratory tests including peripheral blood smear, viral markers (hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C virus antibody), lupus markers (antinuclear and antideoxyribonucleic acid antibodies), and color Doppler sonography of the hepatic portal system were done, but yielded no significant findings.

This association may mislead physicians and thereby delay the early suspicion, diagnosis, and treatment of other diseases. A high index of suspicion is the key to attaining an early diagnosis of CMV infection or reactivation, or other superimposed infections. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient's clinical manifestations closely and attempt to consider other pathologies when the clinical course is unexpected in a patient diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 infection. Severe or prolonged GI signs and symptoms or unexplained worsening of the individual's condition are examples of clinical courses that warrant a new round of taking a detailed history, physical examination, and paraclinical workup if necessary. Maillet et al. reported the case of a 75-year-old man known to have diabetes mellitus, who presented with a 15-day history of fever, chills, myalgia and cough, but no major GI symptoms (6). However, 2 weeks later the patient developed acute-onset nonbloody diarrhea with negative stool cultures for bacteria or parasites, and negative PCR results for fungal infection. He showed no response to conservative treatment. Colonoscopy and biopsy revealed that the patient was coinfected with CMV. New-onset epigastric pain, hemodynamic instability, melena, and a substantial decrease in hemoglobin (7) or the appearance of abdominal distention (8) are among other reported presentations in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and CMV coinfection. Detailed information on cases of CMV infection with GI symptoms reported to date is summarized inTable 1. Our patient developed epigastric pain and odynophagia even to fluids shortly after his discharge from the hospital for Covid-19 treatment. This J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f esophageal symptom was unusual; subsequent endoscopy and biopsy showed a large gastric ulcer, and IHC assay was positive for CMV.",

Furthermore, all patients with GI manifestations of CMV infection were diagnosed in the course of their hospital stay, whereas our patient developed symptoms of CMV infection after discharge from the hospital. The co-occurrence of CMV in our patient may be attributable to immune system dysregulation as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Changes in the immune cell profile, robust activation of the complement system, and abnormal activation of neutrophils are the key features of immune system dysregulation seen mostly in more severe cases (9). These alterations can lead to unregulated and erratic immune responses (both local and systemic), and to cytokine release syndrome. Marked reductions in the number of T-cells (both CD4+ and CD8+), B cells, and natural killer cells (mainly CD4+ cells) are associated with an unfavorable course and prognosis, and may be the main contributor to CMV coinfection or reactivation. In turn, this coinfection per se induces profound systemic inflammatory responses, aggravating the pre-existing kinetics of hypercytokinemia (cytokine storm) (10).",
