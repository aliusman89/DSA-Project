An autosomal dominant pattern is mainly observed but autosomal recessive forms have also been reported [4, 5] . While the diagnosis is mainly clinical, the use of x-rays and confirmation by analysis of the culture of collagen synthesized by the skin fibroblast or blood DNA analysis proves to be necessary in certain cases [6, 7] .",

Osteopenia and bone fragility are significant, with numerous fractures, continuous and severe deformity of the spine, and long bones with age. The sclera is normal. The color changes during the prepubertal period, from pale blue or gray at birth to becoming normal during adolescence or adulthood. The skull bone is poorly ossified with the presence of Wormian bones, and also large and thin. Intellectual ability is not affected [8, 9] .

The clinical picture of OI type 3 and the imaging follow-ups challenged us on a key aspect of radiology, the As Low, As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle. Indeed, OI is an autosomal dominant disease with new mutations [9] . X-ray exposure can produce genetic mutations [12] . Minimizing the x-ray exposure of OI type 3 patients may prove very beneficial. Using chest ultrasound instead of chest x-ray as a routine examination might be a better alternative for assessing respiratory infections. Although chest x-rays are the most commonly used means of diagnosing pneumonia [13] , it has a sensitivity of less than 75% compared to the Ct-scan [14] [15] [16] . And even if the CT-scan has a high sensitivity for diagnosing pneumonia, it is not appropriate for routine investigations [13] . There is a growing body of evidence-based research on the use of ultrasound for diagnosing pneumonia, with a sensitivity around 89-97% and a specificity between 95% and 98% [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .

The non-skeletal respiratory and cardiovascular manifestations have a high rate of morbidity and mortality in severe and moderate forms of OI, but the latter has always been considered manifestations secondary to skeletal changes and not to the underlying mutation of type I collagen [28, 29] . The pulmonary complications represent the leading cause of death in people suffering from OI; usually considered secondary to scoliosis or rib fractures [7, [29] [30] [31] , two case studies of fatal OI with severe pulmonary hypoplasia suggest that collagen damage may be the primary cause of pulmonary complications [32, 33] .",

            "text": "OI type 3 is a rare hereditary disease. This case study presents one of the rare cases recorded in Haiti. Our literature review highlighted the challenges faced by hospitals with inadequate infrastructure, especially in the absence of a surgeon specializing in spine surgery, and also the latest advances in the management of these patients. Due to the possibility of new mutations in OI type 3, the question is how to limit these patients' exposure to x-rays, knowing that exposure to x-rays alone can lead to new genetic mutations. The use of lung ultrasound for assessing respiratory infections has been proposed as an alternative to chest xray, thus solving this new concern.",
