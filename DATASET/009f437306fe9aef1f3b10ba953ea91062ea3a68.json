Influenza vaccines have been our primary tool for infection control to prevent seasonal epidemics and pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus pandemic. Certain high-risk populations, including the elderly, people with obesity, and individuals with comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are more susceptible to increased disease severity and decreased vaccine efficacy. High-risk populations have unique microenvironments and immune responses that contribute to increased vulnerability for influenza infections. This review focuses on these differences as we investigate the variations in immune responses to influenza vaccination. In order to develop better influenza vaccines, it is critical to understand how to improve responses in our ever-growing high-risk populations.",

Unfortunately, current standard-of-care vaccines are less effective in protecting high-risk populations, particularly those struggling with obesity. Despite seroconversion rates in obese individuals being similar to those of their healthy weight counterparts after vaccination, obese individuals are nearly twice as likely to contract the influenza virus and experience more severe symptoms [13] . Although obese adults are also more likely to be vaccinated for influenza than non-obese adults [14] , obese adults typically experience poor initial and adaptive immune responses to vaccination, which compromise their long-term protection [4] . Even adjuvant-containing vaccines, which elicit more neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies than those without, are ineffective in protecting obese mice from homologous influenza challenges [15, 16] .",

One surveillance study found that T2DM tripled an individual's risk of hospitalization due to influenza virus infection and quadrupled their risk of admission to an intensive care unit once admitted [19] . To investigate fluctuating glucose levels, which are characteristic of T2DM during influenza infections, either constantor variable-release glucose pumps were inserted into prediabetic diet-induced obese (DIO) mice [20] . Upon influenza challenge, mice with glycemic variability lost more weight and had increased disease severity than did those with constant glucose levels [20] . This suggests that the inconsistent glucose levels characteristic of T2DM directly influence influenza pathogenesis. Unfortunately, few studies have analyzed the effects of T2DM on influenza vaccine efficacy [21] . The growing prevalence of T2DM worldwide [22] is disconcerting because T2DM has moved from the eighteenth to the ninth leading cause of mortality within the last century [23] .",

After detection of a vaccine antigen, the innate immune system responds immediately.

Humoral immunity encompasses all of the antibody and B cellmediated responses. This is a rapid process upon detection of an antigen in which B cells assist with clearance and protection via sterilizing or broadly neutralizing antibodies to prevent further infection. Proper B-cell activation is critical for effective immune responses to vaccines. Furthermore, B-cell fate determination is driven by infection-induced innate signals to drive early extrafollicular responses and expansion. If these signals are identified, vaccine designs can be tailored to target them for initiating rapid immune protection [34] . B-cell diversity and subset distribution are two important characteristics in healthy immune systems that comprise a diverse B-cell receptor repertoire, broadly reactive HA and NA neutralizing antibodies, and healthy proportions of na\u00efve B cells, memory B cells, and plasma cells [35] (Table 1) .",

T follicular helper (T FH ) cell cytokine presence dictates the expanded isotype, specifically IgM, IgD, IgG, IgE, or IgA. Each isotype contributes different functions in the immune system. Notably, class switching from IgM to IgG and vaccine-specific IgG production are impaired in obese patients, although no studies have determined the mechanism for this [37, 38] ( Table 1 ). The Fc-Fc receptor plays a critical role in affinity maturation via interactions with IgG immune complexes [39, 40] . Driving the maturation of B cells with particular Fc receptor-binding properties to create CD23-elicited antibodies, which are more broadly protective and have higher affinity than HA-specific antibodies, is proposed for universal influenza vaccine platforms [41] . Enhanced interactions with altered glycosylation profiles occur in the context of HIV antibodies, which are broadly neutralizing with higher titers and improved B-cell responses via recruitment of complement [42] . This strategy may enhance vaccine efficacy in obese patients. However, prior vaccination history may lead to decreased antibody affinity maturation to HA domains, resulting in decreased vaccine efficacy [43] .",

HLA class II molecules can present as different isotypes, including HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP [44] . These responses can be enhanced by CD4 + T cells, which contribute to better priming, expansion, and longer-lasting memory. Enhanced stimulation of the expansion of CD4 + T cells, which is critical for protecting the lungs from viral replication along with triggering robust antibody responses, results in higher levels of cross-reactive CD4 + T cells with a greater ability to recognize novel influenza strains [44] . Vaccine strategies that leverage the effector functions of CD4 + T cells have been proposed as a potential step towards universal influenza vaccines [44] . The high mutation rates characteristic of the influenza virus pose the risk of vaccine escape, so optimizing the memory CD8 + T-cell responses when exposed to a novel strain is another proposed vaccine strategy. Unfortunately, cross-reactive clones can also lead to immunodominance which restricts the TCR repertoire and leads to influenza variant escape, the inability to control viral spread, and worsened immunopathology [45] .

For example, metabolically healthy obese individuals possess healthy metabolic markers, despite increased adiposity, whereas metabolically unhealthy individuals in the healthy weight category possess abnormal metabolic markers, despite decreased adiposity [75] . Unhealthy metabolic markers include high fasting glucose levels or insulin resistance; high cholesterol, triglyceride, or lipid levels; and elevated blood pressure [78] .

Interestingly, increased body weight appears to be associated with reduced brown AT in age and obesity-related metabolic disorders [86] . AT is composed of many different cell types, such as adipocytes and their progenitors, endothelial cells, and immune cells [88] .",

Increased body weight results in the expansion of AT, which increases host proinflammatory signals and dysregulates homeostatic immune signals [68] . A study by Li et al. observed that deficiencies in murine maternal vitamin D levels often lead to obesity in their progeny and create polarization within the adipose deposits in the epididymal and inguinal white AT [89] . This polarization affects cytokine expression and immune profiles, highlighting the importance of complex interactions with the AT in dictating immune responses. Vitamin A represents another interesting interaction between AT and nutrients. Retinoic acid, the transcriptionally active form of vitamin A, is linked to obesity and metabolic disease [90] . Adipocytes are critical for the metabolism of retinoic acid, which can modulate AT inflammation and adipocyte differentiation [90] . Penkert et al. found that vitamin A supplementation in DIO mice leads to decreased systemic inflammation, increased antibody responses after vaccination, and decreased viral titers and overall reduced disease severity after viral challenge [91] . Nutrition is an extensively studied factor that plays an important role in immune responses. AT is a highly dynamic, metabolically active tissue that responds to changes in nutrition and is capable of secreting lipids, metabolites, proteins, extracellular vesicles, hormones, and non-coding RNAs that allow for communication and influence on immune responses [92] .",

Macrophages that express TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and IL-6 accumulate in the AT, which contribute to inflammation [93] (Table 1, Figure 1 ). AT inflammation is a critical event leading to MetS, insulin resistance, and other obesity-associated diseases [64, 68] . The macrophages in obese patients can enter the AT to promote insulin resistance and T2DM by converting anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage alternative states to proinflammatory M1 macrophage classical states [46] (Table 1, Figure 1 ). The accumulation of AT macrophages is associated with increased body weight and insulin resistance [47] . Lean AT is primarily composed of adipocytes, high rates of M2 macrophages, and low rates of M1 macrophages [46] (Table 1 ). In contrast, the AT of patients who are obese or have MetS is composed of hypertrophic and necrotic adipocytes, low rates of M2 macrophages, and high rates of M1 macrophages [46] (Table 1) . Diabetic AT is even more complex, with increased rates of M1 macrophages, necrotic adipocytes, and signs of fibrosis [46] (Table 1 ). M1 polarization in AT also occurs in elderly patients [48] (Table 1 ). Macrophages are able to modulate insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis, emphasizing their critical role in high-risk populations [94] . Decreased influenza vaccine efficacy in obese patients may be partially attributed to suboptimal macrophage activity and maturation within the AT [4] . ",

However, obesity with or without MetS reveals characteristic B-cell defects that cause inflammation and autoimmune antibody release. This occurs in elderly individuals, as well [56] (Table 1, Figure 1 ). Indeed, the term \"adipaging\" was coined to highlight how the chronic inflammation and dysfunctional AT in obese patients exhibits similar effects as aging [57] (Table 1, Figure 1 ). Accelerated aging related to obesity is intricately associated with abnormal AT function, which may explain decreased vaccine responses in these individuals [57] . Upon natural influenza infection or vaccination, both obese and elderly populations experience decreased memory B-cell responses against novel antigenic stimulation [58] (Table 1) . Late memory B cells accumulate at high levels in the blood of both elderly and obese individuals. These cells are not responsive to influenza infection and secrete antibodies with only autoimmune specificity, resulting from their constitutive activation [59] (Table 1 ). Elderly individuals also face severely restricted B-cell receptor repertoires, expression of highly specific, non-neutralizing antibodies, and higher levels of age-associated B cells and atypical memory B cells [35] (Table 1) . Vaccination does not improve these immune responses. Compromised vaccine antibody responses also occur with less class switching in B cells and greater counts of proinflammatory-exhausted memory B cells, which in turn reduces the longevity of seroprotective responses [60] (Table 1) . Overall, immunosenescence leaves patients susceptible to severe infections as a result of their deteriorating immune systems.",

Encounters with influenza strains early in life may prevent the immune system from stimulating new responses to current strains [61] . Individuals struggle to mount equally strong responses to novel strains they encounter as adults than to the strains they encountered during childhood [61] . Immunodominance restricts the immune system from mounting broadly protective memory B-cell responses, which are maintained for prolonged periods of time [61] (Table 1, Figure 1 ). This phenomenon was observed in survivors of the Spanish influenza pandemic. B cells secreting specific binding antibodies for that particular influenza virus strain did not cross react with contemporary strains 90 years later [95] . The issue of immunologic imprinting can severely compromise the efficacy of vaccinations over the lifespan of an individual [96] . This suggests that universal influenza vaccines should be targeted for children in an effort to prime their immune responses and curb them to be more broadly reactive and less strain specific. Understanding the core mechanisms regarding an individual's immune history, and especially how it varies in high-risk populations, may be critical for influenza vaccine development [97] .",

All of the obese subjects in their study experienced higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 secretion from B cells that promotes elevated secretion of proinflammatory cytokines than those of their healthy, lean counterparts [62] ( Table 1) . Interestingly, diabetic obese subjects experience deficient IL-10 secretion, which plays a critical role in mediating immune suppression by regulatory B cells [62] (Table 1) . Furthermore, subjects who are diabetic and obese have higher B-cell activation levels but impaired responses to novel antigen stimulation after influenza vaccination, despite having similar inflammatory profiles with those obese non-diabetic individuals [62] ( Table 1) .

Unique inflammatory dendritic cells are generated from inflammatory monocytes to help regulate AT inflammation, accentuating the role of inflammatory dendritic cells in obesity and MetS [64] . Mice placed on a high-fat diet exhibit increased numbers of inflammatory dendritic cells that induce the differentiation of proinflammatory CD4 + T H 17 cells, in contrast with T H 1 cells, while polarizing M1 cells [64] . T H 17 cells often cause the inflammation associated with influenza virus infections and can trigger autoimmune disease, but they can also help control certain bacterial infections. T H 1 cells are typically required for increased resistance to influenza virus infections. Both cell types are induced in parallel and are balanced in healthy patients [49] (Table 1 ). However, in obese patients, the accumulation of macrophages in the AT occurs in a CC chemokine receptor 2-dependent manner and in an independent manner in dendritic cells [50] . This suggests that the inflammatory conditions characteristic of obese AT microenvironments lead to the increased macrophage and monocyte accumulation that is typical in diseased tissues affected by autoimmune diseases [51] .",

Furthermore, Paich et al. observed compromised activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from overweight and obese individuals, which is evidenced by decreased expression levels of CD69 [55] (Table 1) . CD28 expression levels are also decreased, thereby lowering costimulatory signaling, expansion, and survival [55] (Table 1) .

Elderly individuals also experience severely restricted T-cell receptor repertoires, higher expression of restricted T-cell clones, and poor activation, differentiation, and cytokine production levels [35] (Table 1, Figure 1 ). Both elderly and obese populations, as well as those with T2DM, experience immunosenescence and accelerated aging of the immune system, most severely in the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [65, 66] (Table 1 , Figure 1 ). T-cell dysfunction is also implicated as a major contributor of disease pathology in people with T2DM [66] (Table 1) . Increased levels of differentiated end-stage memory T cells mark the cellular senescence that is characteristic of several high-risk populations, contributing to markedly reduced vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "There are several metabolic markers correlating with the presence of MetS, rather than age, that contribute to the systemic inflammation and oxidative stress with repercussions on the immune system [69] . The ATs of obese patients produce high levels of leptin. Increased leptin levels lead to higher food intake and decreased expenditure of energy, while contributing to insulin resistance, T2DM, and cardiovascular diseases [70] ( Table 1) . Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone and a member of the IL-6 superfamily. Leptin is an important starvation signal essential for food intake, energy preservation, and basal metabolism [71, 100] . Leptin also regulates both monocyte/macrophage function and proinflammatory responses because it activates costimulated T cells to induce T H 1 responses [72] . Membrane-bound leptin receptor is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein found on the cell surface of many immune cells, including natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, and B cells [100] . This receptor is important in the JAK-STAT, IRS-1-PI3K, and MAPK signaling pathways, highlighting its broad immunoregulatory functions as a link between the immune system and nutrition [72] . Leptin resistance may occur in obese patients when excessive leptin levels result in attenuated signaling ( Figure 1 ). This is associated with obesity and diabetes, with broad implications on host health [71] (Table 1) , including impaired innate and adaptive influenza-specific immunity and consequentially decreased vaccine efficacy [73] . Leptin resistance prevents proper activation of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells, thereby reducing innate immunity (Table 1) . Leptin resistance also prevents CD4 + T cells from proliferating, expressing adhesion molecules, and secreting IL-2, thereby diminishing adaptive immunity [101] .",

Cell proliferation, as measured by 3 H-thymidine incorporation assays, is higher in lean individuals [38] . Treating B cells with a physiologically relevant dose of leptin in vitro and then stimulating them with CpG decreases vaccine-specific IgG antibody levels, along with mRNA expression of E47 and AID (both of which are indicative of class switch recombination and B-cell activity) to similar levels as those of obese and elderly individuals [38] .

This results in exhausted B cells that replace na\u00efve B cells, beginning a cascade of cell-mediated immunity decline that leaves patients with severely compromised immune systems [58] . Leptin may contribute to B-cell immunosenescence through its proinflammatory properties, which may help to explain why people with obesity have generally poor immune responses to influenza infection and/or vaccination [38] . Additionally, epigenetic modifications leading to B-cell immunosenescence have been seen in aging and T2DM [103] . Decreased levels of microRNAs within the AT that normally regulate inflammation have been linked to vascular disease and aging [103] . The characteristic impaired insulin signaling seen can be improved by silencing endothelial NF-KB, a transcription factor that increases the expression of inflammatory genes as a result of the downregulation of sirtuins that serve as cardiovascular aging and inflammation regulators [103] . Overly active NF-KB can therefore alter innate responses and inflammation within the endothelium, providing a potential link between metabolic disease and premature aging associated with obesity and T2DM [103] ( Figure 1 ).",

Increased proinflammatory cytokines, such as leptin, coupled with reduced anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as adiponectin, may lead to organ-specific diseases and contribute to the onset of T2DM [64, 68] (Table 1 , Figure 1 ). Though the direct effects of adiponectin on pathogen titers has not been investigated, low adiponectin levels, in combination with high leptin levels, may contribute to the pathogenesis of MetS and the increased difficulty of clearing infections. Adiponectin diminishes proinflammatory cytokine generation and deters macrophage activation [67] ( Table 1) . Adiponectin directly controls expression of interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase M, which modulates macrophage reactions to pathogens and leads to hyperresponsiveness, increased proinflammatory mediators, potential cytokine storms [104] , and thereby compromised vaccine responses, when adiponectin levels are low. Overexpression of anti-inflammatory adiponectin in transgenic genetically obese mice improves their metabolic health by normalizing glucose, insulin, and triglyceride levels, despite markedly increased subcutaneous fat mass [74] (Table 1) . Additionally, low adiponectin levels occur in pregnant women and individuals with MetS [105] , suggesting that low adiponectin levels correlate with increased susceptibility and advanced disease severity in multiple high-risk populations.",

A study by Kuo et al. uncovered sex-specific effects of BMI on influenza vaccine responses among a cohort of health care workers at Johns Hopkins Hospital [107] . The study indicated that neutralizing antibody responses to H3N2 decline with increasing BMI in female patients, suggesting that BMI more strongly affects female immune responses than those of men, which is most likely due to hormonal differences [107] . Therefore, such sex-specific differences should be further investigated and potentially considered in future vaccine design.

People may experience the following adverse reactions to a vaccine: immune-mediated reactions, such as inflammation or redness at the site of injection; multisystem reactions, including anaphylaxis or fever; and/or organ-specific reactions, such as rashes or thrombocytopenia [106] . One literature review described the variation of vaccine safety based on administration route and needle length and found that localized reactions are lower with intramuscular injections than with subcutaneous injections [108] . Longer needles more easily reach the muscle and correspond with fewer instances of edema and erythema, whereas shorter needles often result in subcutaneous injections when increased amounts of subcutaneous tissue are present in overweight and obese individuals [108] . The correct needle length should be selected according to an individual's body status to avoid causing unnecessary adverse events after vaccination. Personalized medicine, which allows for the adjustment of adjuvants, dosages, formulations, and the routes of appropriate administration according to factors such as sex, age, adiposity, and metabolic health, may minimize unfavorable reactions and maximize efficacy [109] .",

Many strides have been made to develop novel universal influenza vaccines across diverse platforms, including virus-like particles, syntheticviruses, nucleic acids, and viral vectors [30] . Recent studies tout the promise of HA stalk [110] , NA [111] , or computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen methodologybased [112] vaccines, which appear to offer lasting protection against antigenic drift in mouse models. Another potential avenue is an mRNA-based vaccine, which has been utilized by several companies as a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine platform [2] . The high efficacy rates can be attributed in part to its reactogenic nature. Unfortunately, the increased efficacy comes at the cost of worsened side effects following immunization, leading to vaccine hesitancy [3] . It may not be feasible to implement a highly efficacious and reactogenic annual influenza vaccine if people experience similarly undesired side effects. We must also establish better immune correlates of protection than antibody titers, as determined by HA inhibition assays, because these do not predict influenza protection in high-risk populations. As these novel platforms become validated in animal models of high-risk populations, we can begin to move towards influenza vaccines that are tailored to individual needs, especially because a one-size-fits-all approach has been ineffective to date.",

With less influenza circulation and lower rates of influenza vaccination, our immune responses at a population level may not be protected against the strains that are currently circulating.

This warrants immediate further studies to translate what is known about responses to influenza vaccines into the realm of COVID-19 vaccine platforms because the same considerations and limitations apply.
