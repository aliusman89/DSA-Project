            "text": "Herpesviruses are a diverse group of large double-stranded DNA viruses that share a common virion morphology. Herpesviruses, which belong to the Herpesviridae family, are highly infectious and frequently infect humans for life and persist latently along with the ability to cause recurrent infections [1, 2] . Some types of herpesvirus that can lead to cancer are recognized to be oncogenic, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, also known as human herpesvirus 4) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus 8) [3, 4] . On the other hand, some studies have reported other potentially human oncogenic herpesviruses (HOHVs) with an effect on various types of cancer such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1, also known as human herpesvirus 1), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2, also known as human herpesvirus 2), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [5] [6] [7] . It is known that herpesviruses use the infection strategy \"run and hide,\" and significant complications of these infections can be noticed once the immune system is compromised by various factors that negatively affect the immune system, including physiological and environmental factors [8, 9] . Infections with herpesviruses are currently challenging to cure, and the clinical drugs used to treat them, such as acyclovir and other nucleoside analogs, do not entirely cure the disease or prevent recurrent infections while blocking the viral replication, thus reducing the duration of symptoms and promoting the healing of epithelial damage, lesions, and other cellular damages that were triggered by virus infection [10, 11] . triggered by virus infection [10, 11] . On the other hand, the overuse of these drugs has generated the problem of drug resistance, which in turn has adversely affected the treatment efficacy [12] . Currently, anti-herpesvirus drug development strategies face many challenges, and the most important tasks are linked with developing potent anti-herpesvirus medicines that can conquer the problems of drug resistance, viral latency, and recurrent infections and can also act with diverse mechanisms of action, minimum or no toxicity, and minimum adverse effects [13, 14] . Most drug discovery strategies rely on natural products as a considerable source of new drug candidates with relatively safe profiles, especially from plant sources [15] .",

            "text": "Human herpesviruses are highly infectious agents that cause critical health complications to humans, and herpesvirus host cells are characterized by their susceptibility to productive or latent infections [21] . The host's immune system plays an essential role in the fight against diseases, including viral infections. Once the primary infection originates, the productive infection process takes place, which is then restricted by the host immune response, leaving behind latently infected cells that endure in the host [22, 23] . During latency, several viral genes are expressed, and the viral genomes usually persist as episomes in the nuclei of infected cells. However, viral genomes also have the ability to incorporate into the host genome [24] . It is known that herpesviruses infect different cell types in various tissues, and according to the type of cell and tissue tropism, these viruses are sub-classified [25] . For instance, alpha-herpesviruses (such as HSV) induce latency in the cells of the nervous system, while beta-herpesviruses (such as HCMV) are described with broad cell tropism and can develop latency in progenitors of the hematopoietic cell system. Gamma-herpesviruses (such as EBV and KSHV) expose a more restricted cell tropism and can become latent in the cells with the ability to cause tumors in their infected hosts [24, [26] [27] [28] .",

Saliva exchange is the most known transmitting method for EBV infection and therefore symptomatic initial infection or infectious mononucleosis was described as ''kissing disease\" [51] . There is a strong connection between EBV and the development of cancer, where experimental data confirmed that EBV infection is linked with various human proliferative diseases involving primarily epithelial or lymphoid cells, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) [52, 53] . EBV demonstrates a type II latency mechanism in NPC patients, and this latency is mainly characterized by the expression of Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), which was observed to be vital for the replication, partition, transcription, and protection of the viral genome [54] [55] [56] . Other critical latent membrane proteins and several non-coding RNAs are also expressed by the virus during the latency phase associated with NPC [57] .

            "text": "The direct suppression effect of BBR on EBV infection has been revealed in limited experiments, while its potent antitumor impacts have been explored in numerous in vitro and in vivo studies evaluated in multiple EBV positive-cancerous cells. For instance, in preclinical investigations (in vitro and in vivo), Wang and coauthors [59] showed the capacity of BBR to inhibit the latent and lytic replication of EBV-positive NPC cells and reduce cell proliferation, cause cell cycle arrest, and promote apoptosis in the EBV-positive NPC cells (Table 1) . Their results unveiled diverse mechanisms of action at multiple Viruses 2021, 13, 1014 4 of 18 molecular and cellular levels, suggesting BBR as a promising drug for the therapies of EBV infection and EBV-associated tumors such as NPC. In an in vivo experiment using athymic nude mice, BBR was observed to efficiently hinder the tumorigenicity and growth of EBVpositive NPC cells. The mechanism has been found to correlate with successful inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation in NPC cells [60] . On the other hand, this study did not determine the inhibitory action of BBR against EBV. NPC could also be generated in the absence of EBV infection [61] . Since various drugs could work in a synergistic manner and provide enhanced treatment efficacy [62] , BBR in combination with ginsenoside Rg3 (Rg3; an active molecule from Panax ginseng) was evaluated for improved anticancer properties and was detected to induce remarkable inhibition of NPC cell proliferation (in the absence of EBV infection) in vitro and in vivo. The underlying mechanism has been revealed to affect the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways [63] . In another research performed on EBV-transformed B cells and cancerous B cells, treatment with BBR led to significant induction of mitochondrial apoptosis, clarifying that the role of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein-associated factor 1 (XAF1) as a supporter of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway might offer a novel target for cancer therapy, mainly for cancers with wild-type p53 expression [64] .

This virus is also linked with other malignancies such as primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and a subset of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). KS has been the focus of investigation in KSHV research, as it is the most common acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)related malignancy [67, 68] . KS is a cancer that originates in lymph or blood vessels and commonly appears as lesions on the skin, the inside of the mouth, or internally. Genetic alterations driven by chromosomal instability represent the main feature of KSHVassociated cancers [69, 70] . It has been proved that KSHV can infect several different cell types, including endothelial cells, B cells, epithelial cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts, and the virus uses a specific strategy to attack the host cell, generating latent and lytic infection [71] . The viral life cycle of KSHV, and the mechanisms of inducing latency, have comprehensively been reviewed by Cesarman and colleagues [72] , and we highly recommend the readers to refer to this work for more detailed information. BBR has been involved in extremely limited studies related to KSHV-associated malignancies research, and no antiviral experiments have been performed against KSHV so far.",

In a combined in vitro and in vivo study, Goto et al. [74] examined in depth the antitumor activity of BBR against PEL. Their work employed multiple in vitro biochemical assays, where BBR has successfully inhibited the proliferation of KSHV sequence-positive PEL (BC-1, BCBL-1, and TY-1) cells with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of 13.56, 29.17, and 32.82 \u00b5M, respectively. BBR also caused caspase-dependent apoptosis at concentrations of 30 and 100 \u00b5M. The mechanisms were found to relate to the ability of BBR to block nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation by impeding I\u03baB kinase (IKK) phosphorylation, I\u03baB phosphorylation, and I\u03baB degradation, upstream targets of the NF-\u03baB pathway, in PEL cells. Additionally, the authors used a xenograft mouse model to confirm the in vitro results, where treatment with BBR (at a dose of 10 mg/kg) significantly hindered the growth and invasion of PEL cells compared to untreated mice.",

The oncogenic mechanisms of HSV-1 and HSV-2 have been attributed to their capacity to modulate DNA synthesis and induce mutations.

Several mechanisms have been claimed for the oncogenic effect of HCMV via generating cell cycle progression, chromosomal deviations, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, activating cell motility and migration, and suppressing DNA damage repair and apoptotic pathways [7, 94] . Besides, a new mechanism called oncomodulation has recently been proposed in which the virus infects tumor cells and modulates their malignant activities without affecting cell transformation [93] . The term oncomodulation describes the effects of specific viruses on tumor biology to promote cancer aggressiveness and resistance to conventional treatments [7, 95] . The oncomodulatory effects of HCMV can be detailed by an example of human colorectal carcinoma. Approximately 40% of colorectal carcinoma specimens were found to be positive for HCMV that correlated with unfavorable outcomes, especially in the elderly. Therefore, HCMV can affect the tumor microenvironment of colorectal carcinoma by altering certain cellular functions and signaling pathways regulating processes essential for carcinogenesis and anticancer immunity. Such oncomodulatory effects of HCMV regulating malignant behavior of colorectal cancer cells are brought about through the modulation of various signaling pathways, growth, and consequent promotion of cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. However, the oncomodulatory activity of HCMV needs to be further investigated systemically [96] .",

            "text": "Several experimental findings have provided diverse insights into the blocking of HSV infections by BBR. In a comprehensive study, inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 replications by BBR was determined using the viral plaque assay combined with multiple biochemical analyses. BBR effectively inhibited both viruses and the inhibitory activity was explained by mechanisms of action mediated by modulating the NF-\u03baB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways [100] . Moreover, Chin et al. [101] showed the anti-HSV properties of BBR and its effects on virus adsorption and penetration. Their results concluded that BBR can repress the viral replication cycle by inhibiting late gene products after virus penetration and no later than the viral DNA synthesis stage. Another research group stressed, in an in vitro experiment, that BBR showed slight anti-HSV-2 properties in human vaginal epithelial cells [102] . In addition to isolated BBR, Cortex phellodendri (dried bark of Phellodendron amurense Ruprecht) aqueous extract (CP), which contains BBR as the main compound, showed significant immunomodulatory and antiviral activity. CP exhibited an ability to inhibit viral replication, as demonstrated by reduced green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression and viral titers against HSV-GFP upon CP pre-treatment when compared with untreated groups. BBR as a principal constituent of CP exhibited promising antiviral properties similar to CP with a suggested mechanism that involves type I interferon (type I IFN) stimulation [103] . Other preclinical studies have claimed the ability of 13-hexylberberine hydrochloride (HB-13), a BBR derivative, to suppress the infectivity of HSV-1 and HSV-2 and treat the herpes lesions [104, 105] . Table 2 provides a detailed overview of the above-discussed effects of BBR and its derivatives along with the induced mechanisms against human alpha-herpesviruses. Table 2 .

This approach targets physical properties in the genome of the virus and enables drugs to penetrate the protein shell of the virus and stop genes from leaving the virus to infect the cell. This method does not lead to resistance and works independently of mutations in the genome of the virus. Briefly, the research team found that herpesvirus has high internal pressure (20 atmospheres) because it is tightly packed with genetic material. This pressure permits the virus to infect a cell by ejecting its genes at a high speed into the cell nucleus after penetrating the cell. Therefore, their discovery is based on lowering or turning off the pressure in the genome of the virus without damaging the cell, allowing antiherpetic drugs to effectively fight against the virus [150] .",

The current treatment regimens can help cure the infection symptoms and suppress the viral replication but cannot entirely prevent the reactivation process or restrict the virus from establishing latency. Additionally, the long-term use of anti-herpesvirus drugs has caused the problem of drug resistance, leading to significant treatment failure. Novel anti-herpesvirus drugs with the ability to tackle such difficulties are urgently required.",

We have also focused on presenting the mechanisms and pathways induced by BBR and its effective concentrations or doses responsible for the induced therapeutic effects. Furthermore, this review emphasized various strategies/technologies to increase BBR bioavailability along with other opportunities that could enhance its antiherpesvirus properties. BBR, a multi-functional herbal medicine, showed in preclinical studies remarkable inhibition of multiple targets in the herpesvirus replication cycle. Since no clinical trials have been performed on BBR against HOHVs so far, there is a need to test this drug across various patient populations and conditions, including children and neonates, for whom limited treatment options currently exist. On the other hand, a few clinical trials incorporated BBR (BBR chloride form) to investigate its chemopreventive effect on developing colorectal cancer, a type of cancer associated with HOHV infections. These clinical trials were retrieved from (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ accessed on 21 May 2021) and are summarized in a supplementary table (Table S1 ; please refer to the supplementary file). The performed clinical studies are limited; therefore, further clinical investigations are needed to examine the preventive and therapeutic uses of BBR against HOHV-associated cancers.",
