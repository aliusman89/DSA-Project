            "text": "Introduction: The German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention recommends nominating one authorized medical specialist in every medical department as an infection prevention link physician (PLP). It has been roughly described that a PLP serves as a link between the infection prevention team and the respective clinical departments. No detailed evidence about the contribution made by PLPs to the decrease of infection rates is available in Germany. The \"HygArzt\" project aims to demonstrate the medical and economic benefits of the implementation of hygiene measures by PLP in trauma surgery/orthopedics. Methods: A multicenter interventional pre/post cohort study design was chosen. The study will run for a threeyear period, including a pre-, post-, and an intervention phase, in four different hospitals, one of which will serve as pilot. A complex intervention containing evidence-based infection control measures will be developed and implemented by a PLP to proof efficacy. After the successful implementation of the preventive measures in the pilot hospital, the concept will be transposed to the three remaining trauma and orthopedic departments to confirm the transferability and generalizability. To enable the PLPs of the non-pilot departments, a subjectspecific training program will be developed based on the study results of the pilot hospital and offered to the PLPs. Discussion: Data are intended to provide evidence that and, if so, to which extent the implementation of specific preventive measures by a medical department-specific PLP is possible and results in a reduction of nosocomial infections in orthopedic surgery and traumatology. Contribution to the literature: The present study describes a novel complex study design to prove the effectiveness of intervention measures for infection prevention. The study design and newly developed methodological approach could serve as a model for similar studies on infection prevention in the future. For the first time, the presented research project \"HygArzt\" focuses on the implementation of hygiene measures by an infection prevention link physician (PLP) and investigates whether nosocomial infections, especially surgical site infections, can be reduced by the measures implemented.",

            "text": "Nosocomial infections, especially surgical site infections (SSI), pose a high economic burden to national health care systems by leading to prolonged hospital stays, more surgeries, higher treatment costs [1] , a reduction of the quality of life of the affected patients, and increased mortality rates. The most prevalent nosocomial infections were SSI, accounting for 22 .4%, and resulting in a point prevalence of 1.08% [2] . Therefore, effective infection prevention measures (IPM) are needed. As the number of surgical procedures performed continues to increase [3, 4] , it is even more important to implement effective SSI prevention measures to minimize the patient's suffering and economic damage [3] [4] [5] . Although effective individual measures to reduce SSI are already been implemented, the prevention of infections is often underestimated, such that the number of SSIs has hardly decreased in recent decades [6, 7] .",

Being part of the department, the infection prevention link physician (PLP) has special knowledge and is therefore in a key position to implement the IPM. According to the German infection protection law and the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (KRINKO) recommendations, a PLP should be in a leading position and must be present in every medical department as a link between the department and the infection prevention team trained in a 40-h prevention course. Their tasks include cooperation with the infection control department for surveillance, transmission, detection, and outbreak management [23] . In addition, the PLP should ensure compliance with hygiene and infection prevention rules, improve hygiene plans and functional procedures, and participate in trainings and further education on hygiene topics. The PLP's core tasks are the promotion of interdisciplinary cooperation in infection prevention and the implementation of IPM. She or he should see her-or himself as an intermediary between the departments [23] . Although the effectiveness of the implementation of IPM in hospital departments by nursing staff was described for infection control link nurses [24, 25] , no study has investigated the effectiveness of PLP to date. Our study has as aim to evaluate the effects of PLP to optimize medical processes and reduce the number of nosocomial infections. The associated medical and economic benefits as well as the implementation of IPM by PLP in trauma surgery/orthopedics should be evaluated.",
