Such standard forms are now increasingly available online, behind a paywall or provided for free, sometimes by health insurance companies, raising issues about further use of data. Other patient-directed online formats focus less on producing legally binding living wills but on sharing medical care wishes and preferences that can guide conversations and future decisions (e.g., https://www.ourcarewishes.org).

However, as studies have shown, proxies are often overburdened with this task and find it hard to distinguish between their own and the patient's preferences (13) (14) (15) . Not only do they need to be able to identify what the patient would have wanted in a given situation, they need to be able to communicate well in a clinical setting and they have to be available.

POLST is for frail or seriously ill individuals who are already in medical care (cf. https://polst.org). As POLST is a medical order form and not an advance directive, modifications cannot be carried out by patients themselves but need to involve a licensed healthcare provider (https://polst.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/ 06/2020.06.05-Patient-POLST-Form-Guide.pdf).

Various initiatives have tried to address core challenges, from the basic epistemic problem of how well we can anticipate our preferences regarding future health states, to implementation issues and the largely open question about impact on care (20) (21) (22) . So far, all approaches come with important limitations: Whereas an AD form can offer precise, legally valid formulations, requires little resources and is easily updated, it is hard to know if the documented preferences rest on well-informed and well-reflected choices. Proxy decision-makers differ in their availability and may be more or less able to fulfill their role. POLST and ACP provide professional support that may help patients reach decisions that correspond with their wishes and increase clinical impact but are resource intense and limited to frail or severely ill patients who are already in medical care.

The underlying prima facie assumption is that individuals with a bad quality of life will want to invest less (e.g., in terms of burden of aggressive treatments) in the continuation of their lives than people who are very happy. However, someone who is currently badly off might be very willing to receive curative treatment (e.g., to resolve an acute health crisis), and someone who is approaching the end of a rich, fulfilled life might not be interested in invasive medical interventions in spite of a very decent current quality of life.

This task is facilitated by default milestones that the system offers but that can be disregarded or modified.

Ms X uses the simulation mode to see the cumulative effect of selected milestones on her treatment choices and refines her entries until they fully match her ideas.

Ms X went through the d-AD first herself and then once more with her GP, whom she gave access to her d-AD account.

For example, the risk of identity theft can be reduced by password protection using two factor authentication. In addition, analyzing access control logs allows for early detection of potentials threats-a process in which artificial intelligence will be extremely helpful. It would be fair to offer users one-time access to generate an AD without any data storage or the option to create an account, where data will be stored on a secure server and can be accessed for easy updates and in case of emergency. In that case clients need to be informed about any further purpose the data may be used for. -As terminology and legal requirements for ADs as well as other contextual (e.g., cultural) factors differ internationally, country-specific versions would need to be developed if the tool is to be made globally available. -A digitally enhanced AD app can provide the greatest potential as a part of a digital ecosystem (e.g., an electronic health record) that instigates access to relevant data in the case of a critical health care event. -Automated reminders need to be sent on a regular basis to check that the ACC still reflects current preferences.

Although concepts such as the electronic health record or online informed consent have been available for some time (25) , implementation has been amazingly slow in many countries. We can expect this to change quickly now, even though a number of issues remain to be addressed regarding reimbursement, liability, care coordination and appropriate research methodologies to assess the impact of new developments on patient-centered care (26, 27) . We anticipate digitally enhanced ADs will be part of these developments and believe they can meet the core challenges ADs encounter and that other initiatives have not been able to fully address. Some limitations of Ads, particularly the principle epistemic limitation of imagining a future health state that has never been experienced, may remain, but technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) might help improve the situation. Digitally enhanced ADs can be enriched with infographics or stories that provide information about different treatment options. They can be complemented with modules for specific health conditions or populations. Voice editions can remove barriers for citizens with visual impairment or with low literacy. Ideally, digital ADs will be linked with a patient-driven electronic health record and embedded in a patient-oriented ecosystem. Continuous user input and feedback, from patients, proxies and health care professionals, will help the system steadily learn and improve.",
