It therefore already represents the first component of the envisaged future digitalised healthcare. In order not to promote the emergence of parallel healthcare markets (3 rd Healthcare Market), a rapid rethinking is necessary, above all among physicians requiring more expertise and competence regarding digitalisation. Continuing Medical Education (CME) can accompany and accelerate this process and thus contribute to the success of digital healthcare, which offers solutions to current challenges for the benefit of patients.",

On the one hand, there are great opportunities to make the processes within healthcare more modern and effective in the future. Digitalisation can offer practical solutions for needs and quality-oriented, local treatment of patients [9] . Nevertheless, according to a survey on the website of the Journal of the German Medical Association (\"Deutsches \u00c4rzteblatt\"), 39.8% of the participants do not believe that the lives of people in Germany would be sustainably improved by digitalisation and 21% were undecided (33,687 participants in total between 03.09.2020 and 29.08.2021; 24.8% responded \"rather no\"; 15% \"no, in no way\") [10] . This coincides with another survey in physicians, published in the same journal, in which 63% of the respondents indicated a \"low\" or \"rather low\" willingness to prescribe DiGAs. Seventy per cent would not use digital health apps themselves and 63% of the respondents felt \"rather badly\" or \"badly\" informed about the DVG [11] . A recent survey of the Federal Association of Statutory Health Physicians (Kassen\u00e4rztliche Bundesvereinigung -KBV) has shown that video consultations would be used by 50% of the patients, with geographical variation between urban and rural areas [12] . However, these numbers have probably been biased by the Covid-19 pandemic.",

For this reason, DiGAs are thoroughly examined by the BfArM to determine whether they fulfil the extensive requirements with regard to data protection and security, functional suitability, quality, user-friendliness and interoperability and whether evidence of benefit is available in the form of a clinical study (preferably randomised controlled trial -RCT).

Thus, the principle that the DiGA version listed in the DiGA directory has to be the same as the version used in the pre-approval clinical study poses a challenge in the face of typically rather short development cycles of digital products [15] . As slow integration of digital products into the primary healthcare market in Germany continues, this may lead to the emergence of a tertiary healthcare market: not accessible to everyone (as in an insurance system based on solidarity and subsidiarity), determined by market laws, and privately financed by patients.",

Currently, statutory health physicians in Germany do not seem to have reached the necessary level of digital maturity, one major reason being outdated software and hardware. Further dimensions of digital maturity are the empowerment and professional competence of individuals as well as the integration of digitisation into a corporate strategy and the development of digital business models [17] . These aspects are often missing in physicians' practices. The different dimensions of digital maturity can be classified as \"digital beginners, intermediates, advanced and experts\" [18] .
