Although their inclusion criteria are not known, it is clear that the two cohorts targeted different populations. It should also be noted that the prevalence of positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 either by RT-PCR or LUS might be affected by a small population size, community transmission rates, the testing period, and the intensity of the pandemic for a specific time and location. 2 We also tested the universal screening program in May 2020 using both PCR testing and LUS on 296 pregnant women regardless of the week of gestation who were admitted to the obstetric unit for any indication. 3 The rates of asymptomatic and symptomatic pregnant women with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 were 4% and 3.7%, respectively. In addition, 17.4% of the patients with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 were initially found to be PCR negative, underwent repeated testing in a week because of their abnormal LUS findings, and eventually had positive PCR results.",
