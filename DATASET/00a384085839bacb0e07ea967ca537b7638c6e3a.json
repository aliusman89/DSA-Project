This study aimed to evaluate serum zinc ion level in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and healthy subjects, as well as its correlation with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. 114 COVID-19 patients and 48 healthy subjects (38 healthy volunteers and 10 close contacts of patients with COVID-19) were included. Zinc ion concentration and levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike 1 + Spike 2 proteins, nucleocapsid protein, and receptorbinding domain in serum were measured. Results showed that the concentration of zinc ion in serum from COVID-19 patients [median: 6.4 nmol/mL (IQR 1.5 -12.0 nmol/mL)] were significantly lower than that from the healthy subjects [median: 15.0 nmol/mL (IQR 11.9 -18.8 nmol/mL)] (p < 0.001) and the difference remained significant after age stratification (p < 0.001) or when the patients were at the recovery stage (p < 0.001). Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with more severe hypozincemia showed higher levels of IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Further studies to confirm the effect of zinc supplementation on improving the outcomes of COVID-19, including antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, are warranted.",

Despite the lack of evidence on the direct effect of zinc ion on SARS-CoV-2, its antiviral effects have been demonstrated in various viral infections (7) . As an antiviral nutrient, zinc ion was reported to be able to inhibit replication of rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (8, 9) , picornavirus (10) , and the RNA polymerase activity of SARS-associated coronavirus and equine arteritis virus (11) . Similar to our finding, hypozincemia was reported in paediatric patients with severe pneumonia or Dengue viral infection (12, 13) . Given that serum zinc accounts for only 0.1% of the body's total zinc amount (14) , it is likely that an altered zinc distribution between the intracellular pool and the circulation during infection might explain the observed hypozincemia. In this connection, interleukin-6-mediated induction of Zip14/ SLC39A14 is known to mediate the uptake of zinc into the liver during acute inflammation and infection, which is believed to be host defensive (15) . However, the exact function of altered zinc distribution remains uncertain.",

            "text": "The most notable finding of the present study is that COVID-19 patients with lower serum zinc ion concentration exhibited stronger antibody response against SARS-CoV-2, particularly, the RBD. The SARS-CoV-2 RBD was reported to have strong binding affinity to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which mediates the viral entry (16, 17) . One possibility is that patients with stronger antibody response had higher extent of B cell activation and expansion. In this connection, the uptake of transferrin-bound zinc has been shown to be stimulated in human lymphocytes upon activation (18) . Nevertheless, the effect of zinc ion on antibody response, especially in the context of vaccination, is controversial. It was demonstrated that supplementation with zinc is associated with improvement of seroconversion to vibriocidal antibody in 2-5-year-old children receiving cholera vaccine (19) and is able to boost higher levels of anti-HBs titers in infant receiving hepatitis B vaccination (20) . However, previous studies also showed that zinc supplementation could not promote immunogenicity of rotavirus vaccine (21) or enhance antibody response to multivalent influenza vaccine in hemodialysis patients (22) .",

Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that the post-infectious serum concentration of zinc ion depends on both the premorbid zinc level and the host hypozincemic response during infection.
