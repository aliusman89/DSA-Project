            "text": "In case of vascular injury, platelets detect the presence of subendothelial structures (extracellular matrix components) leading to the adhesion and aggregation of the anuclear cell type and primary hemostasis [1, 2] . Secondary, platelets induce the activation of plasmatic coagulation and hemostasis. For the description of these complex temporal and spatial sequence of events occurring on the platelets' surface, the cell-based coagulation model was developed [3] . Subsequent to clot formation, a further important mechanism of platelets takes place: activated GPIIb/IIIa receptors located on filopodia bind to fibrin, resulting in outside-in signaling of platelets and the activation of the contractile apparatus [4] [5] [6] [7] . As a result, the platelets' filopodia pull at the fibrin fibers to retract the clot [8] . Interestingly, the volume is reduced by the platelets action to at least 50% of volume and is inhibited when the red blood cells are tightly packed [9] . The huge effect of clot retraction has important physiological consequences: the size of the wound is retracted, the firmness of the clot is increased, densely packed polyhedral red blood cells form an impermeable membrane, and ischemia due to thrombosis of a vessel can be resolved by reperfusion [9] [10] [11] . In addition to their function in hemostasis, the clot consisting of platelets, leukocytes, fibrinogen, and erythrocytes coordinates inflammation and wound healing [12, 13] . Inflammation is an important consequence of hemostasis, as injury can potentially be accompanied by the entry of pathogens. Besides leukocytes, platelets are an important and early step in the immune response to danger and infection and constitute an important cell type of both innate and adaptive immunity [2, 14] . Platelets can detect pathogens and danger via pathogen recognition receptors, bind bacteria and viruses, induce the release of bactericidal NETs from neutrophils, and release platelet microbial proteins when stimulated with thrombin or lipopolysaccharides [14, 15] . A further step initiated by platelets is wound repair, propagated by the release of various growth factors from alpha-granules attracting several different cell types necessary for wound healing. In the following, we will highlight the different functions of platelets, from vascular injury to wound healing, and will discuss the involvement in a platelet-centered approach. Moreover, we will discuss the preparation technique and the current use of platelet-rich plasma for local therapies in humans.",

Platelets have a uniform discoid shape, a complex intracellular structure with a cytoskeleton maintained by dynamic action, can synthesize proteins, are capable of dividing, and can respond to various stimuli with shape change, adhesion, aggregation as well as exposure of phosphatidylserine on the surface to induce clot formation and hemostasis [17] [18] [19] . For a long time, the importance of these cells in hemostasis was acknowledged and platelet concentrates are nowadays a valuable treatment option in bleeding patients with thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathy [20] . Besides this function, the involvement in wound healing and immune system function has been recognized. Thus, platelets have been demonstrated to affect inflammation, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and metastasis [2, 21, 22] .",

TLR4-induced activation of platelets results in the release of proinflammatory mediators, the recruitment of leukocytes, and aggregates of platelets with leukocytes or monocytes [15] .

During the development of blood vessels, fibroblasts proliferate and invade into the clot and shift the cellular environment from the inflammatory to a growth state. Differentiation of some fibroblasts to myofibroblasts leads to a further retraction of the wound and finally to scar formation, in parallel to re-epithelialization.

While platelets are shown to be an important source of mediators, there is ample evidence that the other constituents of blood, including leukocytes and fibrin, can also contribute to wound healing. Leukocytes are important for local defense and are capable in releasing growth factors (similar to platelets). However, the eventual harms due to their inflammatory action is an object of the debate. Moreover, the fibrin mesh serves as a scaffold for immune cells, fibrocytes, and stem cells. Different preparation methods of platelet concentrates are shown in Figure 3 .",

It is therefore beyond the scope and the possibilities of a single review to give in-depth information on the use of all subspecialities. According to most reviews and meta-analyses, the level of evidence is somewhat limited by the fact that small studies with few patients and a high risk of bias dominate the literature. Moreover, the use of many different platelet rich concentrates complicates the interpretation and comparison of the results, and the need for studies with standardized platelet-rich concentrates has been emphasized [62] . In this regard, the evidence for the use of other commonly used blood products, including red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, and factor concentrates, is often limited in different settings and reflects that research is most often investigator-initiated studies with limited financial support. Thus, further well-designed prospective studies may be valuable to better judge the advantages and disadvantages of platelet concentrate based therapies and to find the best platelet preparation. However, despite these limitations, there seems to be sufficient evidence in the literature for the use of platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich fibrin in many clinical settings.",

The use of platelet-rich fibrin in the surgical treatment of Class II furcation appears to improve periodontal regeneration. In combination with bone graft substitutes, vertical clinical attachment loss was significantly reduced [83] . Moreover, improved regeneration of the periodontal attachment has been demonstrated [63, 64, 67] . Platelet-rich fibrin membranes are also considered a promising alternative for covering recessions; compared to subepithelial connective tissue grafts-the gold standard-no significant difference in gingival recessions, clinical attachment level, and probing depths were observed [63, 84] .
