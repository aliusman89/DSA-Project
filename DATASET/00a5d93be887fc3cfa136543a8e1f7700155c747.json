In many cases, drugs are still under development and lack a clinical indication, with limited safety and efficacy data in humans to date. These factors will necessarily lead to delays in drug development. Given the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, patients would greatly benefit from interventions with a well-established safety profile readily available for immediate clinical trial testing and rapid knowledge translation if efficacious.",

            "text": "\u2022 Rationale for the dose of treatment: The lowest dose of losartan is 25 mg orally. The maximum clinical dose is 100 mg daily. Losartan has a half-life of 2 hours with an active metabolite E3174 of 6-9 hours. The threshold for blockade of angiotensin-II receptor is at least 20 mg per day. 33 Twice daily dosing has been shown to potentiate angiotensin-II receptor blockade compared with once daily dosing. At this dose, extrapolated data suggests <70% inhibition of angiotensin-II receptors. At the highest maximum allowable dose (50 mg twice daily) we would anticipate >80% inhibition of angiotensin-II receptor. We believe this is necessary as these patients have significant pro inflammatory response. Recent reports indicate that patients with COVID19 have increased plasma Ang II levels and that Ang II levels correlate with COVID19 disease severity and viral load. AT1R inhibition is associated with decreased activity of STAT1 and NFkB downstream signaling as confirmed by western blot analysis. Furthermore, since our initial submission Losartan has been identified for its potential inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV2 viral life cycle based on MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID-19 VERSION DATE:16DEC2020 molecular docking analysis of the coronavirus macrodomain. We propose a dose increase to 100 mg daily (50 mg PO BID in patients without renal dysfunction). We have previously utilized this dose in previous RCTs in HIV (Schacker/Fletcher). These studies confirmed the safety profile of Losartan with a mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction of only 7 mmHg at 100 mg daily and excellent tolerability and safety profile. Our findings confirm prior reports of 6 mmHg mean SBP reduction for Losartan when doses at 100mg daily. Patients will receive intensive safety monitoring as this will be delivered in the inpatient setting with blood pressure checks multiple times per day and minimum required potassium, creatinine and GFR checks prior to enrollment, day 1, 3, and 7 (or prior to discharge). In addition, patients will have routine creatinine and potassium monitored if ordered clinically We hypothesize significant benefit as 4 preliminary and observational reports out of China and the UK suggest significant reductions in disease severity and inflammatory profile for patients treated with ACEi or ARBS with no preliminary reports suggesting harm from ACEi or ARBS in Covid19 patients.",

The most severe risks of losartan use include teratogenicity in the setting of pregnancy, hypersensitivity including angioedema, symptomatic hypotension, worsening of renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities. The most common side effects of losartan include fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, chest pain and anemia. Subjects will be rigorously screened to ensure that they are at low risk for complications due to losartan and they will be monitored closely for side effects and signs of toxicity. The package insert for Losartan has been included with this protocol. Clinical trial and post-marketing surveillance data (see package insert) demonstrate an excellent safety profile. In over 4,000 patients, there was a low incidence of adverse events (2.3%) comparable to placebo (3.7%). The effects more common in losartan than placebo were clinically minor, including dizziness (3% vs 2%), upper respiratory infection (8% vs 7%), nasal congestion (2% vs 1%) and back pain (2% vs 1%). While losartan has the potential to cause symptomatic hypotension, four studies have identified losartan has a negligible effect on resting blood pressure and heart rate in healthy volunteers. [33] [34] [35] [36] While there may be a higher risk in critically ill patients, we will exclude patients with bedside clinician assessment of volume depletion that might increase the risk of side effects. It has been theorized there may be an increase risk of cardiac dysfunction in patients taking an ACE-I or ARB in COVID-19, though evidence for this effect is lacking. We will monitor troponin and BNP/pro-BNP levels in participants and report these data to the DSMB if measured clinically. In fact, the most recent preprinted (nonpeer reviewed) data from China now suggest a protective effect based on retrospective data compared to other antihypertensive regiments. Nevertheless, based on this recent suggestion, we will track troponin and BNP/proBNP measurements in addition to our previously planned assessments of new episodes of hypotension and shock, and report these data to the DSMB. In addition, all patients are closely monitored for clinical purposes given their severity of illness, combined with daily assessments for AEs and SAEs will allow for early detection of side effects and reduce the risks to patients.",

A clinical trial adverse event is defined as any untoward medical event associated with the use of a drug or study procedure. The Investigators will determine daily if any adverse events occur during the period from enrollment (signing of the informed consent) through study day 15. Investigators will determine if the event is serious or related to the study drug. The rationale for this time window is the halflife of 2 hours for losartan and 6-9 hours for its metabolite. Even in the setting of impaired clearance, 3 days after study drug cessation is more than adequate to help to define the period at risk from losartan. Abnormal Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typically be considered serious. Serious adverse events will be collected during the first 15 study days, regardless of the investigator's opinion of causation.

The following are examples of events that will be considered study specific clinical outcomes and will be systematically tracked through the study design. The rationale for this criteria is that these events are likely to be present in a large proportion of the study population, and relatedness will be subject to significant subjective assessment, making adverse event reporting can be sporadic and inconsistent. Therefore, events more likely to be truly related to a study intervention are better treated by consistent tracking through the systemic design and collection of potentially related adverse events: o Respiratory events: decreased PaO2/FiO2, hypoxia, worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome, or respiratory failure. o Cardiovascular events: (need for vasoactive drugs or fluids for hypotension) o Hepatic events: hepatic injury or liver dysfunction that leads to an increase from baseline in the serum level of bilirubin. o Renal events: renal failure, renal insufficiency, or renal injury that leads to an increase from baseline in serum creatinine. o Hematologic/coagulation events: coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis. o Changes in serum sodium and potassium \u2022 Scales Used to Grade Severity of Adverse Events: All AEs will be graded in the following manner: o Probably Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely.

A 50% preplanned interim analysis for safety, efficacy, and futility is planned with specific stopping rules provided to the DSMB as a guide. Assuming a baseline mortality rate of 10%, this corresponds to formal hypothesis testing after every ~2 events initially, and decreasing as data accumulate. If the observed number of events are significantly lower than expected, the DSMB retains authority to decrease the frequency of monitoring (in terms of number of patients enrolled) to MEDICAL PROTOCOL (HRP-590) SHORT PROTOCOL TITLE: Randomized control trial of losartan for inpatients with COVID-19 VERSION DATE:16DEC2020 maintain safety monitoring every ~5 events initially, later expanding to every 10 events. Weekly summary emails of updated AE/SAE rates are provided to the DSMB. Despite the lower number of formal preplanned analyses, the DSMB will still receive near real-time reporting of deaths, and can deviate from this strategy and perform earlier testing if desired. They retain authority to change this plan if the continuous reporting suggests harm prior to the first formal planned assessment if they feel that a formal hypothesis test is warranted. In addition, the DSMB may request additional safety assessments after the 50% assessment, if they feel that additional formal testing is needed.",
