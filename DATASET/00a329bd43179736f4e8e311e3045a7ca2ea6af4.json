Such significant changes pose crucial challenges regarding the risk of developing hyperlipidemia, obesity, and other lifestyle-associated medical conditions. Thus, childhood obesity has increasingly become a concern [11, 12] . Moreover, a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy nutrition may increase cholesterol levels. In addition, because of the lockdown situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of electronic devices, particularly tablets and smartphones, has increased [13] . Isolation and the prolonged sitting and use of electronic devices for long periods have increased the prevalence of sedentary habits and lifestyles in children. In light of these developments, the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has emphasized the need for the resumption of sports [14] . Furthermore, one previous study noted an association between cholesterol levels and nutritional knowledge as well as behaviors in children and their guardians [2] . Another study by Scherr and colleagues iterated the significance of lifestyle factors for cholesterol levels in children [15] .",

It has been reported that cholesterol screening in childhood may facilitate the preventive management of cardiovascular disorders in adulthood [17] . However, the early prevention of hypercholesterinemia in children has not been emphasized. Since it is difficult to test healthy children and to evaluate the effectiveness of health guidance, the active engagement of children attending school in prophylactic activities has been impeded [18] . Children should be motivated to participate in hypercholesterolemia-preventing activities that would help them establish favorable lifestyle habits by adulthood. Moreover, the characteristics of younger children who need assistance with establishing healthy lifestyle habits should be clarified, which would allow for the prioritizing of health guidance provisions in schools without performing blood tests [19] .",

A statistically significant difference was found between the cholesterol values at the two measurement timepoints (p < 0.0001) using t-test. Longitudinal changes in serum cholesterol levels and their association with the demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the participating children were analyzed using two-sample t-tests ( Table 4 ). The total cholesterol levels significantly decreased from the fourth grade of primary school until the first year of junior high school (p < 0.0001). The reduction in total cholesterol levels was significant in both boys (p < 0.0001) and girls (p = 0.0299). Regarding bowel movements, the reduction in cholesterol levels was significant in individuals who had bowel movements every day but not in those who had bowel movements less often. Interestingly, cholesterol levels decreased in participants who wanted to lose weight or thought that their body shape should be as it is, but not in individuals who wanted to gain weight. Children who spent at least a little time but less than 3 h per day on a video game, computer, television, or phone showed a decrease in cholesterol levels. Particularly, a reduction in cholesterol levels was observed in individuals who considered themselves healthy sometimes or always. Interestingly, a cholesterol level reduction was detected in individuals who could not explain lifestyle-related diseases at the beginning of the study. Table 5 describes the analysis of the correlation between cholesterol levels and changes related to growth and weight with continuous variables. The weight and cholesterol level changes (p = 0.0002) as well as weight and cholesterol levels in the first year of junior high school (p = 0.0402) were negatively correlated. In the first year of junior high school (p = 0.0369), cholesterol levels and height were negatively correlated. Moreover, there were strong correlations among cholesterol levels and their changes. The correlation between total cholesterol levels in the fourth grade of elementary school and their changes was negative, and the correlation between total cholesterol levels in the first year of junior high school and their changes was positive (Table 5 ). Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index; TC = total cholesterol; timepoint 1 = fourth grade of elementary school; timepoint 2 = first year of junior high school. Note: Pearson product moment correlation coefficient analysis was conducted; r is the product moment correlation coefficient.",

Our findings also show that children with a heavy weight cannot expect a significant decrease in cholesterol levels simply due to growth, but cholesterol levels may be expected to decrease with growth and good habits; thus, children should be provided with specific longitudinal guidance. Accordingly, our results highlight the need to guide children aged 9-10 years regarding health-promoting lifestyle habits. Previous studies indicated that obesity prevention programs may improve the health outcomes in school children [36] . The current investigation suggests that an obesity prevention program intended for younger children may be valuable for improving cholesterol levels, thereby decreasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Although the effect is recognized, the interests of children of this age and their parents are directed towards their educational studies. This is because elementary school students and parents are less aware of the importance of lifestyle-related diseases, which rarely occur in this age group [37] . Reportedly, in preadolescent children, obesity and health risk do not correlate [38] . This risk is believed to be induced by diet and lifestyle until adolescence [30] . The findings of our study support the idea that cholesterol lowering is pronounced in children with good lifestyle habits. This knowledge contributes to the motivation for elementary-school students to develop habits that prevent lifestyle-related diseases. Our study suggests the need of health guidance considering weight and lifestyle in the fourth grade of elementary school.",
