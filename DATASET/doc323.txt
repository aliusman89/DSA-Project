The recent outbreak of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, underscores the need for understanding the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS and MERS, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene.
We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the 2019-nCoV involving the RBD. Compared with bat isolates, the recent ancestors of 2019-nCoV accumulated a high number of amino acid substitutions in the RBD and likewise in a region of polyprotein Orf1a that is critical for viral replication and transcription. Among these recent mutations, we identify amino acid substitutions common to the SARS 2003 outbreak isolates in positions 427N and 436Y, indicating potential adaptive convergent evolution. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that appears to interact with the human ACE2 receptor. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus whereby the 2019-nCoV ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, those recombinants underwent convergent evolution.

In less than two months since initially reported in mid-December 2019, the recent coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan has caused more than 900 fatalities associated with severe respiratory disease. The causative agent was identified as a previously unknown RNA coronavirus virus, dubbed 2019-nCoV (for 2019 novel Coronavirus), of the betacoronavirus genus 1 , with 80% similarity at nucleotide level to SARS coronavirus 2 .
SARS and 2019-nCoV are the only members of Sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronavirus that are known to infect humans. Other members of this subgenus are frequently found in bats, hypothesized to be the natural reservoir of many zoonotic coronaviruses 3 . In January 2020, a Rhinolophus affinis bat isolate obtained in 2013 from the Yunnan Province in China (named RaTG13) was reported to have 96% similarity to the 2019-nCoV 4 , suggesting that the ancestors of the outbreak virus were recently circulating in bats. However, the specific molecular determinants that enable a virus like the recent ancestor of 2019-nCoV to jump species remain poorly characterized.
The capability of viral populations to emerge in new hosts can be explained by factors such as rapid mutation rates and recombination 5 which lead to both high genetic variability and high evolutionary rates (estimated to be between 10 -4 and 10 -3 substitutions per site per year) 6 . Previous genome-wide analyses in coronaviruses (CoV) have estimated that their evolutionary rates are of the same order of magnitude as in other fast-evolving RNA viruses 7, 8 . Interestingly, evolution within the CoV Spike gene, whose encoded protein interacts with the host cell receptor and is a key determinant in host tropism, appears to occur faster than in most of the other CoV genes 8 . Recombination in RNA viruses, known to be frequent in coronaviruses, can lead to the acquisition of genetic material from other viral strains 9 . Indeed, recombination has been proposed to play a major role in the generation of new coronavirus lineages such as SARS-CoV 9 . Interestingly, a recent study suggests that 2019-nCoV was involved in a potential recombination event between different members of the Sarbecovirus subgenus 1 .
In this work, we investigate the evolutionary events that have led to the emergence of the 2019-nCoV virus. In particular, we identify amino acid changes differentiating the 2019-nCoV genome from the next most closely related betacoronavirus strain, RaTG13, and furthermore, we find evidence of convergent evolution with human SARS-CoV. We also perform recombination analyses testing whether such distinctive patterns could be explained by point mutations and/or recombination. In short, we establish how recombination and subsequent convergent evolution in betacoronavirus likely led to the emergence of the 2019-nCoV strain.
To understand how recombination contributes to the evolution of betacoronaviruses across different viral subgenera and hosts, we analyzed 45 betacoronavirus sequences from the five major subgenera Figure 1 ). This enrichment of recombination events persisted after restricting the analysis to the most common host (bats), suggesting that the recombination is not driven by sampling of multiple human sequences (Supplementary Figure 2) . In all, we find that recombination in betacoronavirus frequently involves the Spike protein across viral subgenenera and hosts.
To study how recombination affects emerging human betacoronaviruses viruses at the viral species level, we focused our attention to MERS, due to the more extensive sampling both in humans and camels, the source of the recent zoonosis 12 . Using 381 MERS sequences (170 from human, 209 from camel and 2 from bat) (Supplementary Table 2 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.10.942748 doi: bioRxiv preprint that includes RaTG13 and Wuhan 2019-nCoV shared 47 amino acids with human SARS in the RBD that were distinct from bat SARS-like CoV sequences (Supplementary Table 3 ). These results do not only demonstrate that 2019-nCoV displays a genotype similar to human SARS in the RBD, but also that it seems to have originated through recombination. To trace back the potential time of this recombination event, we used a Bayesian Phylogenetic approach 13 in the recombinant region (codons 200-500 in the Spike gene) and compared with the whole genome phylogeny ( Figure 3b ). As in the full genome phylogeny, Wuhan 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 were in the same clade, with human SARS-CoV as an outgroup. From our, results we propose two different scenarios. The first is that Wuhan 2019-nCoV derives from a recombination event between human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like
CoV. The second is that there occurred at least two different recombination events, one leading to human SARS-CoV and another one leading to Wuhan 2019-nCoV. In either of these two scenarios, we inferred the time to the most recent common ancestor in the recombinant region of the clade leading to RaTG13 and Wuhan 2019-nCoV to have occurred no later than 2009 (2003-2013, 95% HPD limit).
We then investigated the mutational events that occurred in the Wuhan 2019-nCoV since its divergence The second region that we found with high divergence from the RaTG13 bat virus contained 27 substitutions in the Spike protein, of which 20 were located in the RBD (Supplementary Table 4 ). There was no enrichment in mutations observed at 4-fold degenerate sites, suggesting that those regions do not correspond to any further recent recombination events (Supplementary Figures 5-8 ).
We found only two amino acid substitutions associated with the recent evolution of the 2019-nCoV virus that were also present in all human-infecting SARS-CoV but absent from the recent bat isolate from Yunnan (RaTG13) and likewise absent from any other bat isolate, except for isolates such as Rs7327, .

These two sites, 436Y and 427N, are located in the RBD of the Spike protein, suggesting potential adaptive convergent evolution for Sarbecovirus to infect humans. More specifically, the two sites belong to the short helix ( including changes that were found in human SARS-CoV.
In this work, we have analyzed the recent evolution of Wuhan 2019-nCoV. We present a two-hit scenario involving two major mechanisms of genetic evolution in coronavirus, recombination followed by point mutations, leading to convergent evolution to human SARS virus. We show that the recombination events preferentially affect the RBD region in the Spike gene, both at the order of genus (betacoronavirus) and For each CDS we also compared the distribution of nonsynonymous substitutions with that of synonymous changes (considering 4-fold degenerate sites, detected with MEGA software 7 25 ) occurring between the earliest sampled Wuhan 2019 nCoV sequence (EPI_ISL_404227) and RaTG13.

The evolutionary relationships between 2019-nCoV and other SARS/SARS-like viruses was inferred from genome alignment using PhyML (GTR + GAMMA 4CAT) 26 . The same program and model were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of the (potentially recombinant) RBD, using only 3 rd codon positions.
Dated phylogeny of the RBD was obtained with BEAST v1.8.4 (Supplementary Table 7) , after assessing the molecular clock signal of the selected sequences with TempEst 27 . The analysis was performed with the GTR+ GAMMA (4 cat) substitution model combined with an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model and the Bayesian Skyline Plot demographic model. We used as prior distribution for the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) a normal distribution with mean 40 years (standard deviation 10 years), as previously inferred 7 . Two independent runs of BEAST were performed, with MCMC chain lengths of 5x10 7 states. Convergence of the estimated parameters was confirmed with Tracer http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/.
Sliding window analysis was performed in order to test for enrichment of recombination breakpoints (including both start and end breakpoints) along the viral genome in the following settings: 1) all Beta-CoV recombinations; 2) recombinations within non-human lineages for Beta-CoV; 2) all MERS recombinations; and 3) both human-specific and non-human MERS lineage recombinations separately.
There were too few human-specific recombinations in Beta-CoV for in-depth analysis. For Beta-CoV analyses, the SARS CoV genomic coordinates were used as reference (accession NC_004718), whereas for MERS CoV, we used a MERS CoV sequence (accession NC_019843) as reference.
Windows of 800 nucleotides were selected and binomial tests for the number of breakpoints in each window were performed under the null hypothesis that recombination breakpoints are distributed uniformly along the genome. Given the co-dependence structure of our statistical tests, adjustments were performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure 28 which provides a conservative multiple hypothesis correction that applies in arbitrary dependence conditions. For statistical significance, we chose 5% BY FDR. Our discoveries hold with different choices for window length, provided the window size is sensitive to the scale of interest (namely CoV proteins and the length of specific domains such as the RBD in the Spike).
We used the same sliding window approach to test for enrichment of gene-specific amino acid differences between the 2019-nCoV sequence and the bat virus RaTG13. For consistency, we selected 267 length windows of amino acids (corresponding to approximately 800 nucleotides) and performed p-value correction using the same procedure.
