            "text": "Natural selection has generated a finely tuned gustatory system in vertebrates able to detect, recognize, and differentiate ingestible foods and fluids. As such, taste is a relevant component in the control of ingestive behavior [1, 2] . Taste serves at least three partially dissociable adaptive functions [3, 4] . First, it enables animals to detect and discriminate among tastes (sensory-discriminative). This helps animals characterize the amount and quality of chemical stimuli in foods and fluids-a function that allows them to unconditionally recognize specific nutrients or learn about their postoral consequences. Second, taste promotes the ingestion or avoidance of certain types of chemical stimuli (motivational/hedonic). This function serves to encourage ingestion of needed nutrients and the rejection of potentially harmful substances. Finally, certain taste stimuli trigger specific digestive and metabolic preparatory responses, collectively referred to as cephalic phase reflexes, which optimize the assimilation of nutrients (physiological). Importantly, all these gustatory functions have the potential to significantly impact dietary choices [1, 2] . 3 7 weeks Stimulus Control Test 1 session/animal EchoMRI 4 1 day Tissue Collection 5 2 weeks",

A subset of rats was then given access to high-fat, high-sugar (HFD) chow diet (Research Diets; 45% Fat, 17% Sugar), while the rest of the animals remained on standard lab chow (PMI; LabDiet 5001) as their maintenance diet for 10 weeks. After the 10-week diet acclimation period, animals underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or SHAM surgery and, once recovered, were weaned onto pelleted chow in three diet conditions. Half of the animals that were maintained on HFD pre-surgically were weaned back onto pelleted HFD, and the other half of the original HFD group was switched to low-fat/low-sugar standard lab chow (13.4% fat/8.9% sugar), referred to as the Diet Change (DC) group. Animals that had access to chow during the diet acclimation period were maintained on chow after surgical recovery and referred to as the Chow group. As such, there were three diet conditions: animals maintained only on standard lab chow (Chow), animals maintained on only HFD diet (HFD), and animals that were switched from HFD to standard lab chow (DC). Some animals had more time on HFD before the diet change (range: 10-14 weeks) due to the surgery and recovery timeline. However, there is no reason to believe that this made a meaningful impact on the behavior. Additionally, as explained below, there were several weeks of training that allowed ample time for acclimation to the new diet for the DC animals.",

After surgery, rats that received RYGB were continued on the irontreatment schedule; animals receiving SHAM surgery were switched to saline injections (4 mL/kg). Due to the fact that they are not vulnerable to anemia to the same degree as the RYGB animals, the SHAM animals only received iron before surgery and then were switched to saline treatment; this avoided the risk of iron toxicity. Two RYGB females (one from each phase) were switched to a higher dose of iron (5 mg/kg) to combat paleness, a sign of anemia.",

The following morning, the rats were transported from the vivarium to the surgical suite in clean, empty cages. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with vaporized isoflurane (3-5%/L O 2 ). Animals were shaved from pelvis to sternum, and the exposed skin was cleaned topically with an antiseptic solution and saline. An incision was made along the midline of the skin and then in the muscle layer of the abdomen to expose the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 10 cm aboral from the Ligament of Treitz the jejunum was transected, creating distal and proximal jejunal stumps, which were sutured closed (5-0 PDS II suture). A small incision in the proximal stump of the jejunum was then sutured to a similarly sized incision~27 cm proximal from coecum in a side-to-side anastomosis (6-0 PDS II suture). The gastric pouch was created by transecting the stomach from the esophagus,~2 mm distal from the esophageal connection, and the stomach remnant was closed (5-0 PDS II suture). A small incision in the distal stump of the jejunum was connected to the gastric pouch in an end-to-side anastomosis (6-0 PDS II suture). The muscle wall and skin were then separately sutured closed (4-0 Vicryl suture). SHAM surgery was conducted with similar exposure and manipulation of the intestines and stomach, but no incisions were made in the gastrointestinal tract. Instead, at each location where incisions were made in the RYGB procedure, only a few interrupted sutures were placed. All animals were given analgesics (Carprofen, 5 mg/kg, s.c.) and antibiotics (Enrofloxacin, 2.3 mg/kg, s.c.) on the day of surgery and allowed at least 1 h to recover from anesthesia in the surgical suite before returning to the vivarium.",

For this training phase, LA was dissolved in 5 mM EtOH, and then 0.5% Tween in concentrations ranging from 0.18 mM-0.6 M (v 5 mM EtOH or 0.5% Tween in water).

Each gustometer consists of a sound attenuating chamber that holds an animal testing cage. The testing cage is made of 3 polycarbonate walls, 1 stainless steel front wall, and a wire mesh floor. The front wall has 3 parallel access slots through which an animal can lick fluid from 1 of 3 balls. The center ball (borosilicate glass) is attached to a mechanical arm that positions the ball in front of the center access slot and allows the sample ball to rotate on its horizontal axis. The sample stimulus is pumped from a reservoir outside of the sound attenuating chamber, through PFTE tubing, and dispensed onto the sample ball as an animal is licking. When a trial is complete, the mechanical arm moves the sample ball away from the access slot to a position where it can be rinsed (with dH 2 O) and dried (with pressurized air) before being repositioned back in front of the access slot for the next trial. Response balls (polyoxymethylene) are fixed on either side of the sample ball. Animals are reinforced with water that is dispensed through a Tygon \u00ae tube (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics, Malvern, PA, USA) through the core of each response ball.

The concentration of the taste stimulus was systematically decreased until the animal could no longer distinguish it from dH 2 O (chance performance, 50%).

Most of the musculature from the anterior portion of the tongue were removed, and the epithelium, remaining muscle, and connective tissue were pressed between two glass slides. This technique allows the clear identification of pale-staining fungiform papillae intermixed among the stained non-gustatory filiform papillae under a light microscope.

This was performed to prevent extinction in animals that had clearly reached their limits of stimulus detectability.

Performance of the animals was averaged at each concentration (including extrapolated data) and used to generate mean curves for each diet and surgical group. In order to assess differences between groups on each of the three parameters of psychometric functions (asymptote, EC 50 , and slope), we used two-way ANOVA. Paired comparisons were used to dissect significant interactions or main effects of diet or surgery and were conducted using t-tests applying Bonferroni corrections when appropriate.

The surgical group designation for the acclimation period (before surgery) was based on the surgery each animal would eventually receive. As expected, HFD exposure (in the HFD and eventual DC groups) drove significant increases in body weight and percentage change during the acclimation period compared to the rats maintained on chow. Moreover, following surgery, RYGB promoted significant decreases in body weight relative to each respective SHAM diet condition. Significant decreases in weight were also noted in the SHAM DC group relative to both the HFD and Chow SHAM animals. Effects of diet and RYGB on absolute weight and changes in weight were observed throughout the experiment, primarily driven by weight gain in the HFD SHAM animals and lower body weights of the animals with RYGB in each diet condition.",

Following threshold testing in Phase 2, the rats were subjected to an EchoMRI, and fat pad weights of the retroperitoneal, gonadal, and perirenal fat pads were also collected ( Figure 4 , Table 5 ). For the interpretation of these data, it is critical to acknowledge that these statistics must be viewed with caution because of the low sample sizes (see Table 2 ). As such, only between-group comparisons for Chow, DC, and SHAM conditions were conducted. Total fat pad weight (Figure 4a) , and the individual weights of the retroperitoneal (Figure 4b) , gonadal (Figure 4c) , and perirenal ( Figure 4d ) fat pad weights were significantly decreased by RYGB in the Chow and DC groups (p's < 0.008), but there was no difference between RYGB DC and RYGB Chow groups (p's > 0.096). Additionally, there were significant effects of diet among the three SHAM groups on total, retroperitoneal, and perirenal fat pad weights (Table 5 ), but in paired comparisons there was only a trend for HFD animals to have greater values compared with the DC and Chow groups likely because of insufficient power. Analysis of the body weights on the day of the EchoMRI scans (Figure 4e ) revealed that the RYGB animals in the Chow and DC groups weighed significantly less than their SHAM counterparts and did not differ between each other (Table 5 ). There was also no main effect of diet on body weight among the three SHAM groups (Table 5) . RYGB animals did have significantly lower percent fat mass (Figure 4f) , and greater percent lean mass, compared to their SHAM counterparts in the DC and Chow groups and did not differ between each other (Table 5 ). An ANOVA indicated a significant main effect of diet for the three SHAM groups on both percent fat mass and percent lean mass. An inspection of Figure 4 suggests that this was primarily driven by differences between the HFD group and the other diet groups (Table 5 ). However, none of the paired comparisons were statistically significant; this is likely a consequence of low power. There were no differences between the groups on percent bone mass. ",

Two-way (surgery \u00d7 diet) ANOVA revealed no significant effects of diet and surgery, nor a significant diet by surgery interaction on the asymptote or slope of the NaCl functions or the asymptote, slope, or EC50 (threshold) for sucrose functions (Table 7 ). We did find a significant surgery by diet interaction for NaCl EC 50 due to a surgery effect in the HFD group (Table 7) ; however, no significant differences between the groups survived Bonferroni corrections. Moreover, it is important to exercise caution because the effect of diet may be exaggerated by one outlier in the SHAM HFD group. Additionally, it should be highlighted that there are no differences between the three SHAM groups or between the three RYGB groups. The effect of surgery for each diet condition on individual animal performance across concentrations can be observed in Figure 6 (a-c for NaCl threshold testing; d-f for sucrose). At the end of detection testing, animals completed a stimulus control test (Figure 7) . During this test, all reservoirs were filled with the solvent (dH 2 O or Tween) and half of them were arbitrarily assigned as the taste stimulus and the other half as the solvent. Animals that are under stimulus control and, thus, are relying solely on the unique chemical properties of the stimulus to drive responding, should perform at chance (50%). The rats from Phase 2 were tested with dH 2 O; however, rats from Phase 1 were tested with 0.5% Tween. This was conducted because, in Phase 1, after sucrose testing but before the stimulus control test, an unsuccessful attempt was made to assess detection thresholds to the polyunsaturated fatty acid and linoleic acid, which was dissolved in Tween. It is assumed that the different solvents have no impact on the interpretation of the outcomes of the stimulus control test. A few animals were removed early from the study (n = 5) and did not complete a stimulus control test. However, based on individual concentrationdependent performance in these cases, we are confident that those rats were under stimulus control and were relying exclusively on chemical cues when detection thresholds were analyzed. One-tailed binomial tests revealed that all animals were under stimulus control after Bonferroni corrections were made. Brown shading or outlining represent the Chow group; blue, the Diet Change; pink, the High-Fat Diet. One-tailed binomial analyses were used to test for differences greater than chance, represented as significant by \"*\". Although the performance of Rat 32 was significantly greater than chance, it was quite poor, and the difference did not survive Bonferroni correction. The horizontal dashed line represents chance performance in this task.",

The measured thresholds for each group agree with those reported from other taste detection studies that used a similar testing paradigm [69, 70] with intact male rats. However, one group reported a significant effect of HFD on taste thresholds for sucrose using conditioned taste aversion in a rat model of obesity [80] . In that study, male rats maintained on HFD had significantly lower sucrose thresholds than did chow-fed rats. In the evaluation of the disparity in outcomes, it is important to consider that there were important conceptual and methodological differences between the two studies. Conceptually speaking, the conditioned taste aversion procedure is designed to alter the hedonic evaluation of the conditioned stimulus. In contrast, the two-response operant taste detection task used here does not rely on the hedonic properties of the stimulus to drive responsiveness, rather the tastant serves as a cue to guide choice. In the former procedure, the sensory-discriminative and hedonic properties of the stimulus are conflated and difficult to disambiguate. Indeed, there is evidence to suggest that maintenance on a high-fat diet influences hedonic responsiveness to palatable stimuli. Some studies have found that rodents maintained on a high-fat diet display decreased motivated responsiveness to sugars relative to chow-fed animals [81] [82] [83] . Methodologically speaking, there were a number of issues that differed between the Sun et al. study [80] and ours. In the former, male rats were presented a series of daily 30-min two-bottle tests with descending sucrose (which served as the conditioned stimulus) concentrations and threshold was defined as the concentration at which the conditioned group did not statistically differ in sucrose preference from the unconditioned group. In our study, we tested female rats and took a more traditional psychophysical approach and determined thresholds for each animal individually by fitting curves to their concentration-performance functions and then derived EC 50 , which we operationally defined as threshold because it represents the inflection point and is optimally suited to discern lateral shifts in sensitivity along the concentration dimension. We then compared these EC 50 values across groups. Moreover, in the two-response taste detection procedure, the tastant ingested on a given trial is limited to 10 licks, and the animal is forced to rapidly report the presence or absence of the stimulus, two methodological features that buttress the conclusion that behavior was under orosensory control.",

Here, notwithstanding a possible effect on NaCl sensitivity in the HFD condition, RYGB did not significantly influence the taste detection thresholds for NaCl or sucrose. These results suggest that reported changes in food selection and taste preference, at least in rodent models following RYGB, are not likely due to a surgery-induced influence on sensory-discriminative taste function, at least as measured by detection thresholds. The basis for the difference in outcomes between our study and those assessing patients after gastric bypass surgery might have several origins. First, there is always the possibility that this represents a fundamental species difference. Second, it is possible that the exact nature of the psychophysical procedure used to assess thresholds across studies may have an impact on whether surgery-induced changes in perithreshold taste sensitivity are observed. Third, the exact timing of the threshold determination postsurgery may be critical. In our study, we tested rats when they were no longer in their weight loss phase, whereas, in humans, all the studies were conducted on patients within 6 months after surgery when body weight is still changing. These are not mutually exclusive possibilities.",

            "text": "After RYGB, the rats in our study displayed the expected decrease in body weight and fat mass, and the predicted accompanying changes in circulating postprandial plasma levels of GLP-1 (increased) and leptin (decreased). Leptin is thought to selectively decrease behavioral and neural responsiveness to sweeteners and the leptin receptor (Ob-R) is expressed in taste buds [84] . A mutant strain of obese mice (db/db) lacking a normal functioning leptin receptor (Ob-R) displays enhanced preference for, and chorda tympani nerve (innervating taste buds on the anterior tongue) responses to, sweeteners including sucrose [84, 85] . The administration of leptin decreases such responses in wildtype mice but not in db/db mice. Indeed, it has been shown that, in humans without obesity, sucrose recognition thresholds covaried with diurnal changes in leptin levels such that sensitivity was higher in the morning when leptin levels were lower, and they were lower in the evening when leptin levels were higher; recognition thresholds for other nonsweet tastants did not vary in this manner [86] . Interestingly, in humans with obesity, the positive relationship between plasma leptin and sucrose recognition thresholds disappears and is replaced by a negative one such that higher leptin levels are associated with increased sucrose sensitivity [86] ; this outcome was attributed to leptin resistance. It appears that the effect of leptin on peripheral taste processes saturates at plasma levels~15-20 ng/mL [84, 86] . However, for those rats from which we were able to sample blood at the end of the experiment, all but two (which were in the SHAM HFD group) had postprandial plasma leptin levels that were below 15 ng/mL, and there was no significant relationship between leptin levels and sucrose (or NaCl) EC 50 for either RYGB or SHAM rats, nor for the two types of groups combined. Moreover, while RYGB significantly decreased plasma leptin levels in the DC and Chow groups relative to their SHAM counterparts, these groups did not differ in their sucrose (or NaCl) sensitivity. One important consideration is that we only assessed plasma leptin levels at the end of the experiment and not during the sensory test sessions. While this limitation may have influenced the variance of leptin levels within groups affecting correlations with behavior, it is unlikely to have affected the differences between groups. It should be noted that a leptin-related decrease in behavioral or taste nerve responsiveness to sweeteners has not always been observed in mice, even when leptin levels are below 10 ng/mL [87, 88] . Thus, whether circulating leptin affects taste sensitivity still remains an open question; we did not see evidence for it as assessed here.",

It is important to stress that we only measured detection thresholds here. It is possible that other measures of taste sensitivity including the recognition threshold, which is the lowest concentration at which the quality of the stimulus can be identified, or suprathreshold intensity measurements, might be influenced by RYGB or diet. It is, therefore, plausible to consider that, while diet and RYGB did not influence detection threshold, these manipulations might exert an influence on recognition threshold and/or perceived suprathreshold intensity. The latter measure, which involves psychophysical scaling procedures such as magnitude estimation, can only be applied with humans. That said, the use of the two-response taste detection procedure to assess detection thresholds has proven to be exceptionally sensitive to genetic, pharmacological, and anatomical manipulations of the peripheral and central gustatory system in rodent models [69, 70, [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] [95] .",

The HFD that we used was purchased from Research Diets (D12451), and it was compared to common laboratory chow (Purina 5001). These diets differed on many different characteristics, and it is possible that changes in the formulations used to compose these foods could result in different outcomes. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the presence and concentration of specific components in diets can impact neural and behavioral responsiveness to taste, including effects on taste detection thresholds assessed with a task similar to the one used here, through their action on salivary protein expression [94, 96] .",

Likewise, fungiform papillae density was found to be negatively correlated with an anthropometric marker of obesity in humans [79] . Expression of inflammatory and taste-signaling markers in taste buds has also been reported to be altered by HFD exposure in mice [16, 79] and related to obesity in humans [97] . Here, there was no evidence that chronic exposure to HFD (nor RYGB) influences the quantity of taste buds in female rats. Of course, we cannot dismiss the possibility that different maintenance diets or diet exposure times may have revealed effects. It is also possible that either maintenance diet or RYGB could have influences on the relative numbers of different taste bud cell types or taste receptor cell function. There is evidence that HFD exposure also alters some signaling properties in taste receptor cells [17] . However, if such events were occurring in our rats, they did not influence psychophysically assessed taste detection thresholds for sucrose and NaCl.",

These findings suggest that reported changes in food choice and preference associated with RYGB, at least in rats, are not likely driven by changes in very basic sensory functions of the gustatory system. The fact that liminal sensitivity to taste compounds tested here was refractory to our dietary and bariatric manipulations, both of which have salient physiological consequences, suggests that basic sensory-discriminative taste function is relatively immune to such challenges, perhaps to ensure that foods and fluids in the environment can be reliably detected and identified regardless of external or internal conditions. Such basic sensory information can then be acted on by other neural circuits to appropriately modify an animal's behavior in an adaptive manner.",
