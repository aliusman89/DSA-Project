The structure of beginning online instructors' perceived competencies was widely discussed, and it was also confirmed that the structure and level of online teaching competencies would be varied across countries and different cultural backgrounds. Followed U.S. theoretical framework, some studies discussed the differences between Chinese and U.S. online teaching and instructors. But how Chinese online instructors, especially beginning online instructors, perceiving the online teaching competencies, and how this framework would differ from the U.S. framework, was less discussed. To fill in this gap, this study explored the structure of Chinese beginning online instructors' competencies using the Bayesian factor analysis method. With a limited sample size, the traditional factor analysis trail reported undetermined results with three options. The results of Bayesian factor analysis indicated the three-factor solution is the most appropriate solution with the collected data. The three factors are named \"preparing and supporting online teaching,\" \"creating an appropriate environment for students' learning,\" and \"conducting appraisals of student learning.\" The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) discussing the structure of Chinese beginning online instructors' perceived competencies, (2) discussing why and how the structure of online teaching competencies varied across countries, (3) providing practical suggestions for online instructors' training programs, and (4) providing methodological guidelines in factor analysis with small sample sizes for applied researchers.",

            "text": "As online learning continues to mature and evolve in higher education, both faculty and supporting staff need instruction on how to design and deliver effective online courses . It is reported that online enrollments of higher education in the U.S have continued to grow with about 31.6% of higher education enrollments in 2016, which has increased 4.5% compared with 2012 (Seaman et al. 2018) . According to the 40th Chinese Internet Development Report (2020) of China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), the number of Chinese Internet users reached 940 million by June 2020, the number of online education users reached 381 million. The number of online education users grows more than 50-fold from 2001 to 2020, and this number is expected to continuously grow in the future (CNNIC, 2020) . In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, millions of students participate online learning. Although online learning continues to grow, many teachers are still resistant to adopt online courses for the barriers, such as uncertainty about the effectiveness of online learning and the lack of confidence in online teaching competencies (Wingo et al. 2017) . Notably, the structure of beginning online instructors' competencies can assist faculties with online course design and delivery. Thus, a great deal of attention has been paid to online instructors' competencies, especially for beginning online instructors who have less than three years of online teaching experience. They are key members in determining the quality of future online education (Lim & Newby, 2020) . To measure the competencies of beginning online instructors, the Beginning Online Instructor Competencies Questionnaire (BOICQ) is designed with five dimensions: preparing him/herself to teach online, selecting appropriate tools, preparing learners to learn online, facilitating online learning, and conducting meaningful appraisals of student learning. The target population of BOICQ, as it was designed, is all the beginning online instructors . But the validation of BOICQ only includes a sample recruited from the beginning online instructors from the U.S. Similar to other measured abilities or skills, the construction of online instructors' perceived competencies may differ fundamentally due to different nationality, cultural background, policy, and other educational practices. Hence, as we try to understand and measure the perceived competencies of beginning online instructors from other countries, e.g., China, a further discussion of the structure of BOICQ is necessary.",

Goals represent the broad outcomes of a program, while objectives are more specific learning outcomes. It is supported that the competencies' hierarchy in online education is shown in Fig. 1 . On the other hand, it is recommended that competencies are linked to roles and skills. and ) used the ordinates to identify competencies based on teacher roles as shown in Fig. 2 .

The top 20 blended teaching skills, include flexibility and personalization, mastery-based learning, data usage and interpretation, learning management system usage, online discussion facilitation, and software management. and ) investigated eight award-winning online faculties in the U.S and found that online instructors used a systematic design process, backward design, considered learner needs, and designed learner interaction during the design process. Award-winning online faculty use a variety of assessments, including using traditional and authentic assessments and rubrics to assess students. Bigatel et al. (2012) identified the most important observable teaching behaviors in evaluation rubrics and how these items compare to established online teaching competencies. It indicates that online teaching competencies should be clarified by observable instructional behaviors. Bell et al. (2017) explored the Environmental Management competencies online through experimental study and found that that the practice of authentic activities with group collaboration is essential to students' online learning. The Visible, Organized, Compassionate, Analytical, Leader-by-example (VOCAL) is a well-known online teaching competency framework. It consists of establishing a social presence; designing and organizing plans, presentations, and timing; handling students' problems; evaluating and improving the system; and modeling best online teaching practices (Savery, 2005) .",

Online education has received favor from all education stages, including but not limited to primary and secondary education, vocational education, higher education, and continuing education. Although online education is applied widely, the differences between traditional teachers and online instructors, especially in competencies, are not highlighted in China. Traditional teachers occupy a great proportion of the population of online instructors in China. In the pre-service teacher training programs in China, Under the background of soaring but lacking of professional training, studies focusing on online teaching in China often follow the framework in the U.S (Tsai et al. 2018) . Some studies figured out the differences between Chinese and American online teaching, especially focusing on online instructors. From the perspective of communication and the interaction between teachers and audience, studies found Chinese teachers prefer to use teacher-centered and unidirectional strategies, no matter online or face-to-face. Xie and Teo (2020) examined how 160 top-and secondtier Chinese and American universities appraised themselves in the \"About Us\" texts on their official websites and found significant cross-country and cross-tier differences in the ways the universities project and position themselves to their stakeholders. Li et al. (2017) compared online instructors' perception of high-quality teaching between U.S. and China and found that instructors from both countries believe teaching design is determinate to students' engagement in learning, but Chinese instructors tend to use heuristic explanation, while U.S. instructors prefer to apply reflection, collaboration, and exploration in the teaching process. As for interaction with learners, the teacher-centered interaction is typical for Chinese instructors, while U.S. instructors prefer to facilitate student-centered interaction.",

The difference in the perception of competitive instructors' characteristics implies the structure of perceptions in competencies may differ fundamentally between Chinese and the U.S. beginning online instructors. As a result, we have a strong reason to believe that the structure of the perceived online teaching competencies between the two groups of online teachers may be different fundamentally. For beginning online instructors, since they are lacking of experience, the perception of competitive characteristics may relate to their perception of competencies closely. Hence, it is extremely necessary to explore the structure of teaching competencies in Chinese online instructors and how it differed from the U.S. framework directly.",

The PCA, on the other hand, seems does not have a rigorous limitation of sample size due to its mathematical nature. However, the PCA also cannot utilize the information contained in the data perfectly. Also, as a result of its mathematical nature, the PCA cannot provide definite answers for the exact factorial solution. Researchers have to work subjectively to determine the number of factors and which factor should be loaded on for each item. For traditional factor analysis with a smaller sample size (n < 300), researchers are suggested with a small number of factors to keep the results stable (Kline, 2016) .

The first model was estimated with small iterations as the default setting of RStan. Each model included four chains, and within each chain, the withdrawal warm-up iteration was 1000 and the total iteration was 2000. That means for each model, the valid iterative sample size would be 4000 for all four chains. In this study, these models were called \"small iteration models.\" For the second model, a larger number of warm-ups and iterations would be applied. For each of the four chains, the iteration in the warm-up process was 4000 and the total iteration number was 14,000. That means for each model, the valid sample size was 40,000. In this study, we called these models \"large iteration models.\" We use both small and large iteration models because the RStan manual indicates the small iteration models are suggested to small sample size data (Stan Development Team, 2017). However, large iteration models would be more helpful in generating stable results and observing how the parameter estimation was stabilized. As a result, six BCFA models would be estimated in total.

But the 5-factor solution did not report the same convergence situation. Figures 6 and 7 present the tracing plots after the warming up process for the 5-factor solution. We can observe from these figures, the four chains did not converge with each other and even did not reach a stable estimation within each chain. In general, the one-factor and three-factor models reported well convergence but the five-factor solution did not. This means the one-factor and three-factor solutions were valid, but the five-factor solution was not, no matter the number of iterations. But for the item residuals, all the models reported well convergence both within and between the chains. The R s from the Gelman and Rubin Statistic indicated the same conclusion as tracing plots for model convergence. 3 Generally, the R s higher than 1 indicates not well-converged models. All the factor loadings for one-factor and three-factor models were all-around 1, no matter the number of iterations. For both the one-factor and three-factor models, the chains were converged with each other in both small and large iteration models.

Since used a convenient sample with a limited sample size, the sampling bias would be generated through this process. Also, since the Bayesian factor analysis's complexity makes it takes a longer time to investigate the relationship among factors, this study did not report any information about the relationship among three factors. Further studies would be addressed on the structure of Chinese beginning online instructors' perceived competencies with larger sample size, the relationship between different factors, and key variables that would affect individual levels on these factors. Conducting meaningful appraisals of student learning 32. Create an online rubric that assesses higher-order thinking skills. 33. Create an online quiz or exam. 34. Provide corrective, supportive, confirming, and informational feedback on assignments and postings. 35. Write guidance describing rationale for assignments, including the grading criteria.",
