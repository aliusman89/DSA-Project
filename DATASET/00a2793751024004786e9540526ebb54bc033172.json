Under normal circumstances, a dynamic equilibrium exists between an organism and its external environment, and stress arises when this equilibrium is upset or is self-perceived as upset 5 . Stress is believed to be closely linked to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease, one of the most important psychosomatic diseases 6 . Although the biological mechanisms remain unclear, the current literature suggests that self-perceived stress may cause over-activation of the autonomic nervous system and elicit a stress response from the endocrine system, thereby inducing endothelial dysfunction, ultimately triggering cardiovascular events 7 . However, the process by which stressors exert their effects on an organism is not linear; instead, it arises through interactions 5 . The stress perceived by an individual reflects his/her subjective evaluation of the stressor and will partly depend on individual attributes. Studies have shown that different individuals faced with identical stressors may perceive considerably different levels of stress, with different effects on CHD occurrence and development, resulting in differences in the severity or prognosis of CHD 8 . Therefore, the accurate identification of high-stress individuals is of great significance for the precise assessment and subsequent treatment of CHD. deviation (x \u00b1 s); variables not normally distributed were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR).

Therefore, recent models of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation require cardiac rehabilitation specialists to accurately assess and identify high-stress individuals for targeted, stratified management. The mean CPSS score of Chinese patients with CHD in our study was 27.16 \u00b1 6.35, which was slightly higher than that of the normal population 11 .

However, this result is contrary to the findings of studies conducted in other countries [15] [16] which have indicated that individuals with lower educational attainment generally perceive higher stress. This may possibly be attributed to the long-standing, strong emphasis on educational attainment in Chinese society, which has led to the general view that individuals with higher educational levels should attain greater personal achievements and bear greater social responsibilities and expectations. However, it is not clear whether this unique sociocultural background has caused the aforementioned difference between Eastern and Western countries in the influence of educational level on perceived stress.",

Participants who engaged in mental labor had higher perceived stress than did those who engaged in manual labor; in other words, they had a higher probability of a high perceived stress score (OR: 1.389, CI: 1.144-1.686). Such a result is not in complete agreement with the findings of previous studies. A survey by Lesage et al. 17 revealed that differences in perceived stress among administrative, technical, and blue-collar workers were statistically insignificant. However, the 501 participants of Lesage's study were selected from individuals who attended occupational health centers in northern France, whereas the participants of our study had a greater diversity of occupations, including teachers, doctors, taxi drivers and gardeners. The greater diversity of occupations included in our study provides a better reflection of the actual range of perceived stress across occupations, thereby helping the occupational factor to reach significance. D\u0117del\u0117 et al. 18 performed a cross-sectional study on perceived stress among 571 full-time workers in Lithuania and found that blue-collar workers who spent relatively more time engaging in physical work had a higher risk of high perceived stress than white-collar workers, which appears to contradict our results. However, the ecology is more complex among individuals engaged in mental labor than among manual workers, which may have partially contributed to the difference in perceived stress we observed between the two occupational categories.",

We also found that the probability that risky alcohol drinkers were assessed as having high stress was 1.492 times that of non-risky alcohol drinkers (CI: 1.146-1.944). These findings are consistent with those reported by Yoon et al. 19 , who showed that the proportion of individuals with adverse drinking habits was higher in the population with high perceived stress than in the population with low perceived stress. Although the study by Yoon et al. did not investigate possible causal relationships between high stress and at-risk drinking, there is no doubt that patients with a habit of risky alcohol consumption can have higher perceived stress.

Previous studies have disagreed on these aspects. For instance, a study by Andreou et al. 20 indicated that younger individuals, women, and single or divorced individuals may have higher perceived stress. Cohen et al. 9 reported that perceived stress was higher in women, but unrelated to age; similar conclusions were reached in two other studies [21] [22] .

A study by Leung et al. 12 indicated higher levels of perceived stress in women, but a contrary result was reported by Ojard et al. 23 Although the measurement of the perceived stress of an individual is based on his/her subjective perceptions, it may also be affected by objective environmental stressors.

Further multicenter studies with a larger sample size are therefore warranted to validate the accuracy and clinical value of the present results. Second, although we were able to screen factors that were possibly related to perceived stress, we were unable to infer causal relationships given the cross-sectional nature of the study. To address this limitation, we plan to conduct further prospective cohort studies to further investigate the effects of the relevant factors on perceived stress in patients.",

Individuals who engaged in mental labor, had a habit of risky alcohol consumption, and had a higher level of educational attainment had a higher probability of scoring high on perceived stress. These results can provide a scientific basis for further investigation of the relationship between stress management and prognosis in patients with CHD. We recommend the formulation of individualized stress management programs in cardiac rehabilitation to provide additional care to individuals with the aforementioned characteristics.",

Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (0 = never, 1 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 160 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often), with items 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 13 scored in the reverse 161 direction. Total scores range from 0 to 56 points, with higher scores indicating higher 162 psychological stress. 163 In addition to the CPSS, all the participates were asked to complete the Patient 164 Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) 165 scale to assess preexisting mental health comorbidities. The PHQ-9 is a self-rating scale 166 consisting of 9 items. A PHQ9 score greater than 5 indicates that the patient may be in 167 a mild or more depressive state. The GAD-7 is a 7-item self-rating scale indicating a 168 mild or more anxiety state when the score is greater than 5. 169 All the participants were asked to provide responses based on their own perceptions. concomitant diabetes mellitus (see Table 1 ). 195 The mean CPSS score of all the patients with CHD was 27.16 \u00b1 6.35. Using the 196 median score of 27 as the cut-off point, the study participants were divided into a low-197 stress group (CPSS score \u226427) and a high-stress group (CPSS score >27). 198 Participants who had children, engaged in mental labor, or had a habit of risky 199 alcohol consumption had a higher probability of experiencing higher stress perception 200 levels. (see Table 2 ). Model 2 was adjusted by GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, which has no major influence on 218 the conclusion (see Table 3 ).",

(see Table 2 ). Model 2 was adjusted by GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores, which has no major influence on 206 the conclusion (see Table 3 ).",

Finding out the potential risk factors of coronary heart 54 disease and subsequent targeted treatment is a severe challenge. Recent studies 55 demonstrated that psychological and social factors play an important and independent 56 role in the development of coronary heart disease. (stress) refers to the psychological challenge or threat caused 58 by various triggering events or adverse life factors and usually manifests as emotional 59 discomfort, pain, or anguish 5 . Under normal circumstances, a dynamic equilibrium 60 exists between an organism and its external environment, and stress arises when this 61 equilibrium is upset or is self-perceived as upset 6 . Stress is believed to be closely linked 62 to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease, one of the most important 63 psychosomatic diseases 7-8 . Acute mental stress caused by sudden accidents or illness 64 may be a trigger for cardiac events such as myocardial ischemia or Takotsubo 65 cardiomyopathy. 9-10 The process of seeking medical care for patients with an acute 66 coronary event could be another stressor itself. 11 Meanwhile if certain acute stress 67 becomes persistent, it will change to chronic stress. A meta-analysis 12 suggests that high 68 stress is associated with a moderately increased risk of incident CHD. The current 69 literature suggests that mental stress may cause over-activation of the autonomic 70 nervous system and elicit a stress response from the endocrine system, thereby inducing 71 endothelial dysfunction, ultimately triggering cardiovascular events. 13-15 A latest 72 study 16 revealed that the amygdala, a stress-sensitive structure, may increase the 73 incidence of cardiovascular diseases by improving the activity of the immune system, 74 which might be a possible mechanism. Stress-induced platelet bioactivity increase and 75 prolongation may also be involved in this process. 17 76 It was also found that the process by which stressors exert their effects on an 77 organism is not linear; instead, it arises through interactions 6 .

However, the 275 distribution of perceived stress across occupations may depend on the social 276 environment. With China's vast population, Chinese workers are often faced with 277 complicated interpersonal relationships in their workplace. In general, workplace 278 ecology is more complex among individuals engaged in mental labor than among 279 manual workers, which may have partially contributed to the difference in perceived 280 stress we observed between the two occupational categories. 281 The drinking habit of patients with CHD has also been identified as a potential 282 factor associated with perceived stress. Our results indicated that participants with a 283 habit of risky alcohol consumption had higher perceived stress. . These findings are 284 consistent with those reported by Yoon et al. 36 , who showed that the proportion of 285 individuals with adverse drinking habits was higher in the population with high 286 perceived stress than in the population with low perceived stress. Although the study 287 by Yoon et al. did not investigate possible causal relationships between high stress and 288 at-risk drinking, there is no doubt that patients with a habit of risky alcohol consumption 289 can have higher perceived stress. Therefore, for such individuals, emphasis should be 290 placed on appropriate stress interventions in the formulation of rehabilitation programs. 291Interestingly, we also found that patients with CHD with children were nearly twice 292 as likely to perceive the stress as those without children, which is consistent with the 293 findings ofLesage et al. 24    294",

Considering that perceived stress may 229 play some role in the occurrence and development of CHD, a greater emphasis has been 230 placed on stress management in comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programs 231 because it may potentially provide benefits, such as improving the long-term prognosis 232 of patients with CHD. 28 In this study, we investigated the stress perception level in the Chinese CHD population and explored the possible influencing factors associated with 234 them.

Previous studies have shown242    that demographic characteristics such as age, sex, educational level, marital status,243    family structure (with/without children), nature of work (mental/manual labor), the 244 presence/absence of mental health comorbidities, sleep disorders, other chronic 245 diseases, and the following habits: regular exercise, risky alcohol consumption, and not completely consistent. We also observed in the clinic that patients implanted with 248 multiple stents tend to be more stressed.Our results showed a strong correlation between perceived stress and educational250 level in Chinese patients with CHD. A higher educational level was associated with 251 higher perceived stress However, this result is contrary to the findings of studies 252 conducted in other countries 26, 38 which have indicated that individuals with lower 253 educational attainment generally perceive higher stress. This may be attributed to the 254 long-standing, strong emphasis on educational attainment in Chinese society, which has 255 led to the general view that individuals with higher educational levels should attain 256 greater personal achievements and bear greater social responsibilities and expectations. However, it is not clear whether this unique socio-cultural background has caused the 258 aforementioned difference between Eastern and Western countries in the influence of 259 educational level on perceived stress. The perceived stress level was also found to be strongly related to the nature of 261 work in the Chinese population. Participants who engaged in mental labor had higher 262 perceived stress than did those who engaged in manual labor. Such a result is not in 263 complete agreement with the findings of previous studies. A survey by Lesage et al. 24 264 revealed that differences in perceived stress among administrative, technical, and blue-265 collar workers were statistically insignificant.

First, we conducted the study in CHD patients308 referred to the cardiac rehabilitation center in our hospital, which might bring 309 selection bias and the stress levels in the general population only had historical 310 control. Also, a multi-center study to further evaluate the CPSS score in CHD patients 311 and the general population all over China is ongoing. Second, when screening 312 influencing factors associated with the CPSS score, the variables we included might 313 not cover all the possible factors. The effect size should be interpreted with caution 314 due to the low variation of marital status and other potential missing covariates. Third, our study didn't clarify whether the CPSS score would associate with the clinical 316 outcome of CHD patients, which might be a candidate topic we should investigate In conclusion, individuals who had higher educational attainment, engaged in mental 320 labor, had children and had a habit of risky alcohol consumption were much easier to 321 perceive the stress. The results of this study might help to stratify CHD patients 322 according to stress perception level and supply the individualized stress management 323 programs for Chinese populations with CHD. The study was initiated by JM and YX. YG performed the statistical analysis and 327 drafted the manuscript. RH, YZ, and MY were helpful for data collection. JM and YX 328 contributed substantially to its revision. JM and YX took responsibility for the 329 manuscript as a whole.
