Hence, identification of antigens eliciting protective antibody responses is of great importance as potential vaccine candidates. Antibody responses against various malaria parasite proteins have been extensively studied for vaccine development (Fowkes et al. 2010) . The malarial vaccines can be basically divided into pre-erythrocytic, blood stage and transmission blocking vaccines (Richards and Beeson 2009) . The erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium are responsible for the symptoms and clinical manifestations of malaria, and thus the antigens during these stages are considered as important targets for vaccine development (Ellis et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "Merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1) is one of the most extensively studied blood stage malarial antigens (Cruz-Gallardo et al. 2013; Holder et al. 1992) . MSP-1 is a 190-230 kDa protein expressed on the merozoite surface of Plasmodium species of parasites. MSP-1 is mainly expressed during the trophozoites stage and is proteolytically cleaved into four major fragments, MSP-1 83 , MSP-1 30 , MSP-1 38 and MSP-1 42 at the time of schizogony (Blackman et al. 1991; Holder et al. 1992 ). Subsequently, the MSP-1 42 fragment is cleaved further into MSP-1 33 and MSP-1 19 portions during merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. The MSP-1 33 is released into the circulation, while MSP-1 19 remains on the merozoite surface and is carried into the newly invaded erythrocytes. It has been shown that high plasma levels of anti-MSP-1 antibodies are associated with protective immunity against malarial infections (Egan et al. 1996; John et al. 2004; Okech et al. 2004; Stanisic et al. 2009 ). In vitro studies have shown that anti-MSP-1 19 antibodies can inhibit parasite growth and in turn confer protection from malaria (Blackman et al. 1990; Egan et al. 1999 ). Anti-MSP-1 19 antibodies are also associated with reduced parasitemia and decreased clinical symptoms of P. falciparum (Pf) infections, suggesting that these antibodies have anti-parasitic characteristics (Fernandez-Becerra et al. 2010; Shi et al. 1996) . Even though antibody responses against MSP-1 are associated with protection against clinical malaria and disease severity; these associations are known to vary across different endemic regions (Braga et al. 2002; Branch et al. 1998; Egan et al. 1996; Greenhouse et al. 2011; John et al. 2005; Riley et al. 1992) .",

            "text": "Mangaluru is a southwestern coastal city in Dakshina Kannada district of Karnataka state in southern India. Over the past two decades, people in this region have been fighting against malaria and is still considered to be endemic in this region (Punnath et al. 2018) . Malaria in this region is caused by P.vivax (Pv) and P.falciparum infections, with Pv being the major infecting species (Punnath et al. 2019c) . From 1990 onwards, malaria cases in Mangaluru city and its surroundings have exponentially increased and continue to remain at high levels till now (Punnath et al. 2018) . This spurge in malarial cases has been due to rapid economic expansion and urbanization which led to import of large numbers of migrant laborers from other endemic areas of the country. These immigrants are primarily employed as laborers in construction of building and road works. The stagnant water at construction sites serves as ideal breeding ground for vector propagation leading to a high vector density and transmission in the region. These laborers are mostly economically underprivileged people and live within construction sites and crowded residential areas, aiding in the continuous spread of malarial infection (Dayanand et al. 2017) .",

The plates were later washed with PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween-20 in 1X PBS) (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 times at room temperature (RT). To reduce non-specific binding, the plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-Tween (0.05% Tween-20) for 3 h at RT, washed. The diluted serum (1:100 in blocking buffer) samples/negative control were added in duplicates, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Only patients infected with either Pf or Pv were considered as positive samples in this study. The serum samples of 6 unexposed Europeans who were na\u00efve for malarial infections were used as negative control and blank wells without serum (as background) were used. Following additional wash, the total IgG were detected by incubating at RT for 2 h with a HRP-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG antibody (cat # 9040-05, Southern Biotech, AL) at 1:10,000 dilution, and the subclasses were determined with mouse anti-human IgG subclass antibodies IgG1 (9052-05, Southern Biotech, AL) at 1:2000, IgG2 (9060-05, Southern Biotech, AL) at 1:6000, IgG3 (9210-05, Southern Biotech, AL) at 1:50,000 and IgG4 (9200-05, Southern Biotech, AL) at 1:20,000 dilution.

            "text": "Acquired immune responses against malarial antigens are known to play an important role in protection against malaria. Among the various antigens studied so far, merozoite surface protein (MSP-1 19 ) is one of the highly immunogenic malarial antigen and a promising malaria vaccine candidate. Several studies in diverse endemic regions have demonstrated high prevalence of antibodies against Pv-MSP-1 and Pf-MSP-1 antigens (Ak et al. 1998; Egan et al. 1995; Olotu et al. 2012; Park et al. 2001; Soares et al. 1999b Soares et al. , 1999c Torres et al. 2008; Valderrama-Aguirre et al. 2005; Wilson et al. 2011) . In this study, we aimed to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the recombinant Pv-MSP-1 19 and Pf-MSP-1 19 during Pv and Pf infections in the endemic setting of Mangaluru. We also tried to understand whether these antibodies confer a protective role in patients with common morbidity parameters such as malarial anemia and thrombocytopenia (Gupta et al. 2013; Quintero et al. 2011 ). Our data is in agreement with reports stating that Pv-MSP-1 19 and Pf-MSP-1 19 are highly immunogenic and elicit a rapid humoral response especially during acute infections (Park et al. 2001; Yeom et al. 2008; Zeyrek et al. 2008) . In this study, we observed over 80% patients to be seropositive against recombinant Pv-MSP-1 19 (85.4%) and Pf-MSP-1 19 (87.9%) antigens which is in agreement with earlier studies (Soe et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2016) . Such a strong induction of antibody responses could be due to priming the existing antigen specific memory B-cells from previous malaria exposures. Studies suggest that even in areas of low transmission and in the absence of reinfection, the memory B-cell responses to malarial antigens is maintained over long time, resulting in long lasting circulatory antibodies (Akpogheneta et al. 2010; Min et al. 2017; Ndungu et al. 2013; Wipasa et al. 2010) . In this study, we found that even though levels of anti-MSP-1 19 antibodies were found to be increased with increase in number of prior exposures, the antibody responses were found to decrease in individuals with over 6 months of previous exposure and hence the antibody responses against these MSP-1 19 antigens in this endemic setting seems to be only short lived.",

            "text": "The antibody subclasses against malaria antigens mediate different immune effector functions (Nimmerjahn and Ravetch 2008; Stanisic et al. 2009 ). The prevalence of antibody subclass also varies in different endemic settings. The IgG class switching is not only influenced by the antigenic structure but also due to previous exposures and host factors (Ak et al. 1998; Branch et al. 2000; Mehrizi et al. 2011; Metzger et al. 2003; Taylor et al. 1998 ). In agreement with previous studies in various endemic regions, we also observed a significant induction of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies, with a similar trend of subclass prevalence against recombinant Pv-MSP-1 19 and Pf-MSP-1 19 antigens (Egan et al. 1996; Mehrizi et al. 2011; Morais et al. 2005; Stanisic et al. 2009; Tongren et al. 2006 ). Most IgG responders had antibodies belonging to subclass IgG1 and IgG3 followed by IgG4 and IgG2. Being the major type of antibodies produced against the merozoite antigens, IgG1 and IgG3 (cytophilic subclasses) are expected to contribute significantly in opsonization and complementmediated lysis of merozoites (Nebie et al. 2008; Polley Fig. 1 Antibody levels against the recombinant Pv-MSP-1 19 and Pf-MSP-1 19 : The percent seropositivity in healthy endemic controls (HEC) and among P. vivax, P. falciparum patients was measured against a Pv-MSP-1 19 and c Pf-MSP-1 19 . The serum IgG antibody levels against b Pv-MSP-1 19 and d Pf-MSP-1 19 was measured in HEC and in patients with P. vivax, P. falciparum infections by ELISA. Data is shown as median \u00b1 interquartile range and were analyzed by Kruskal Wallis test for multiple comparisons. ns indicates nonsignificant data,***,**** indicate significance of p B 0.001 and p B 0.0001, respectively J Parasit Dis et al. 2006; Rzepczyk et al. 1997; Tongren et al. 2006 ). On the contrary, IgG2 and IgG4 (non-cytophilic subclasses), may compete with cytophilic antibodies for antigen recognition (Groux and Gysin 1990; Roussilhon et al. 2007; Stanisic et al. 2009 ). The high prevalence of IgG4 ([ 50%) subclass antibodies in this study, likely competes with cytophilic antibodies for antigen recognition and may therefore block cytotoxicity mediated by antibody-activated effector cells, and in turn with increased susceptibility to malaria (Aalberse et al. 2009; Aucan et al. 2000) .",

            "text": "Antibodies produced in response to malaria are expected to confer protection from progression of mild malaria into (Menendez et al. 2000; Punnath et al. 2019d) . Milder forms of anemia can result in considerable shown as median \u00b1 interquartile range were analyzed by one-way nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for comparison between two groups and Kruskal-Wallis test for multiple comparisons. * and **** indicate significance at p B 0.05 and p B 0.0001, respectively morbidity especially in younger children and pregnant women, whereas SA is of main concern due to its high mortality rates, mostly in children below 2 years of age (Fernandes et al. 2008; Muhangi et al. 2007; Punnath et al. 2019d ). In spite of decades of research studies, the mechanism of anemia is not completely understood and is not only credited to hemoglobin digestion and red blood cell destruction, but also due to increased splenic clearance, oxidative stress, bone marrow changes and sequestration in various organs (Castro-Gomes et al. 2014; Punnath et al. 2019d) . It was observed that the administration of purified IgG from immune adults to malaria patients confers protection against severe malaria by reducing parasitemia (Sabchareon et al. 1991) . Studies in children with SA revealed that immune complex (IC) may contribute an important role in erythrocyte destruction leading to development of malarial anemia (Mibei et al. 2005) . Also, experiments with Pf showed that tagging the surface of uninfected RBCs and erythroid precursor cells in bone marrow by parasite proteins may elicit a specific antibody response, triggering phagocytosis and complement activation and inducing the clearance of these cells, eventually leading to anemia (Awah et al. 2011 (Awah et al. , 2009 Layez et al. 2005; Sterkers et al. 2007) . It is clearly evident from the results of this study, that the circulatory levels of anti-MSP-1 19 antibodies were higher in patients with increased anemic severity during Pv and Pf infections. We predict that these anti-MSP-1 19 antibodies and other non-specific antibodies can have affinity to the MSP-1 19 antigens leading to formation of IC's on RBC's surface (both infected RBC's and uninfected RBC's). Such changes on the surface of RBCs can lead to activation of complement system leading to increased phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages leading to increased RBC destruction and an aggravated anemic severity (Awah et al. 2011 (Awah et al. , 2009 Facer et al. 1979; Sterkers et al. 2007 ). Thrombocytopenia is one of the most frequent hematological complications observed during malaria infections. Though commonly found, the mechanisms leading to this complication and its subsequent effects on disease progression are poorly defined (Lacerda et al. 2011; Punnath et al. 2019b) . Thrombocytopenia seems to occur mostly by peripheral destruction, bone marrow alterations, excessive removal of platelets by splenic pooling, platelet consumption by the process of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), pseudo thrombocytopenia due to clumping of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes, oxidative stress and antibody mediated platelet destruction (Punnath et al. 2019b) . Observations in animal studies with experimental model of Plasmodium berghei, indicate a potential role of platelet associated IgG and CD4-T cells in platelet destruction (Grau et al. 1988 ). Among various mechanisms, thrombocytopenia is also likely to be associated with binding of parasitic antigens on platelet surface. This leads to binding of circulatory antibodies to the malarial antigens resulting in the formation of immune complexes (Kelton et al. 1983; Lacerda et al. 2011) . The increased immune complexes can lead to activation of complement system and increased phagocytic clearance by monocytes and macrophages (Grynberg et al. 2007; Lacerda et al. 2011; S 2009) . As observed in this study, both anti-Pv-MSP-1 19 and anti-Pf-MSP-1 19 antibody levels were found to be higher in patients with increase in severity of thrombocytopenia. We speculate that the binding of host anti-MSP-1 19 circulatory antibodies to the antigens on the platelet surfaces results in increased platelet destruction and eventually thrombocytopenia. Based on the observations in this study, further in vitro biological assays are required, to gain a better understanding of the immunological aspects, and therefore eventually aid in design and development of future interventions especially in patients with severe malarial complications.",

The IgG levels also increased with number of repeated infections. However, the persistence of circulatory levels of antibodies was only short lived. Among the 4 IgG subclasses, cryophilic antibodies IgG1 and IgG3 were predominant; the induction of IgG4 antibodies indicates that the overall antibody responses may not play a protective role. The increased levels of antibodies in severe anemic and thrombocytopenic patients suggest that anti-MSP-1 19 antibodies may play a potential role in pathogenesis of malarial anemia and thrombocytopenia. In general, this study also suggests that the seroprevalence analysis can be used as a tool to understand the changing epidemiology patterns across various malaria hotspots and in particular Mangaluru and its surroundings.",
