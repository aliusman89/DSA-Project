All of them are publishing the number of new individuals infected, recovered and dead individuals, along with some supplementary material. These data are often recorded in a non-uniform manner and do not conform the standard definitions of these variables. In this paper we show that, using data from the first wave of the epidemic (February-June), Kaplan-Meier curves calculated with them could provide useful information on the dynamics of the disease in different countries. We developed our scheme based on the cumulative total number of infected, recovered and dead individuals provided by the countries. We present a robust and simple model to show certain characteristics of the evolution of the dynamic process, showing that the differences in evolution between countries are reflected in the corresponding Kaplan-Meier-type curves. We compare the curves obtained for the most affected countries at that time, with the corresponding interpretation of the properties that distinguish them. The model is revealed as a practical tool for countries in the management of the Healthcare System.",

            "text": "Since its first detection in China, COVID 19-disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus-has spread to different parts of the world to reach pandemic status in a short period of time. This has created a social and scientific challenge, in which understanding how the virus behaves is crucial to stop its spread. A classic tool in the analysis of epidemics that could be used in this sense is the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival model (1) that allows to calculate the stepwise survival probability of a fixed group of patients suffering from a disease [see for example (2, section 15) for a contextualised explanation of the topic]. Kaplan-Meier curves provide an easy and visual way to understand processes involving a population of individuals that is decreasing over time. They give the rate of individuals who still remain in a group-in our case, individuals who still remain under the control of the corresponding national health system-after a given time, and can therefore be understood as an estimate of the probability of this occurring. Comparisons of the curves for different countries provide a method for analyzing the different strategies that countries used at the onset of the pandemic. In a first approximation, the rapidly decreasing curves could be understood as a sign of the efficiency of the strategies developed by the countries, but this simplistic explanation cannot be established as a general rule, since the data presented by the countries on the pandemic also involve variables other than the response capacity of the health systems. However, we have found-and this is the main contribution of the present work. that countries can be grouped according to the shape of their Kaplan-Meier curves, which opens the door to a global analysis of the strategies-including data management, medical treatment, isolation measures and other relevant actions-used throughout the world. For this research, we collected data from the database of John Hopkins University (Coronavirus Resource Center), which provided an internationally accredited source of information. Of course, depending on the country the data were affected by a lot of different biases, so we have no choice but to assume that the national strategies we want to consider in our comparative analysis include the data management itself. In other words, we consider the management of these data as a component of the national strategies to fight Covid-19. But there is another fact that is even more problematic for the mathematical analysis: the data are aggregated-they are essentially given by the number of new infections, deaths and individuals cured each day, so a disaggregation (deconvolution) procedure is necessary to obtain Kaplan-Meier curves. The mathematical issue of doing this was studied in our work (3), where several analytical-heuristic methods are considered. Finally, we decided to use Genetic Algorithms for our overall analysis, as it was the method that was shown to be the most efficient. However, although the question of comparing different calculation procedures is interesting in itself from a mathematical and computational point of view, it is not the aim of the present work, in which we try to present some information on comparative treatments against pandemic situations using a synthetic information resource: Kaplan-Meier curves. The proposed method which would allow a prediction of how, given an average infected individual, his or her infection status changes over time. As we have explained in the precedent paragraph, the nature of data collected on the pandemic in different countries is diverse and this model needs to be adapted to the specific case of COVID-19 to provide relevant information. As will be shown in the paper, each country has its own survival curve with strong differences, which cannot be justified as a unique consequence of local population characteristics: a survival curve should only depend on the virus, assuming the usual degree of homogeneity in the infected population. Therefore, the reason for the strong difference in the results in different regions have to be sought in two directions: first, the way countries are reacting to the epidemic, and second, the characteristics of the data these countries have made public.",

            "text": "In addition, current models are not sensitive enough to capture the different dynamics of different virus strains. This is because viruses with RNA as their genetic material are less stable than those with DNA and tend to accumulate a greater number of mutations. This means that the virus changes more quickly, ending up in different variants of the same virus that have different mortality and infection rates. Furthermore this feature raises the fear about future cases of re-infection, where the virus differs enough from previous versions to evade the immune system again-as such other virus with the same genetic material do, e.g., Influenzavirus A, that causes the common flu and is able to infect us repeatedly (4) . This scenario may occur as other coronaviruses are able to infect humans periodically such as HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-229, that are responsible of one out of five colds (5) . The mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2 is not known yet, but given its potential, the possibility should be considered.",

Therefore, the problem comes from the data. But this fact does not invalidate the usefulness of the Kaplan-Meier curves. Here, we show that some significant patterns can be detected by comparing the curves constructed for different countries. In further applications, survival curves could also provide some useful information for decision-making on the implementation of strategies against the spread of COVID-19, such as the length of confinement periods or the intensity of new case detection policies. In this work we use the available data of the dynamics of the disease COVID-19 to understand the survival of the virus that causes it, SARS-CoV-2. Although more information is already available on the second wave of COVID-19 in the countries we have analyzed, we have opted for the methodological approach of using data from the first wave-February to June. The reason is because this period defines a complete (almost closed) cycle of infection. Since we are interested in drawing some methodological conclusions from the experience, we believe that this procedure allows a more stable framework for obtaining them.",

These are functions that are sensitive to changes in the epidemiological data of different populations. This makes the model adaptable to reinfection scenarios and other more subtle differences such as the virulence of different strains (6) . Together with some usual models for predicting the amount of new infected population, this allows the development of a complete model for the evolution of newly infected individuals, people who must be kept in quarantine and individuals who have already overcome the disease. To approximate the solution of the equations we use a genetic algorithm approach (7) , which provides estimates of the probability and therefore clear images of the expected infection scenario. A full explanation of the mathematical method we have developed to do this is available in (3) .

The meaning of the quantities appearing in this model has a straightforward interpretation. Let us start with the explanation of the probability distribution P. For example, in the case of Spain (Figure 1 ) 62 days after being classified as infected a standard patient has a probability of remaining infected of 0.2. In other words, 20% of the patients listed as infected the first day (t = 0) will still be labeled as infected after 62 days (remaining in the hospital or at home in quarantine). It can be seen that there is a significant decrease in the curve in the first 10 days. Indeed, since S(1) = 0.96 then after one day 96% of infected people will still be infected whereas 10 days later only the 53% will be. However we need 52 days more to reduce the percentage to 20%. The shape of these curves is the main element of our analysis.",

As a consequence, the reported number of \"admissions\" in the system (registered infected people J ) is greater than the number of discharges (X ) over a long period of time, so it takes longer to reach equilibrium.

The number of \"admissions, \" although initially much higher, is rapidly decreasing, approaching the number of \"discharges.\" The curve shows a rapid decrease in the probability of an individual remaining infected, followed by a flattening of the curve in which a slower decrease is observed corresponding to the normal evolution of infected individuals in hospitals (Figure 3) . This would also be caused by-or together to, a powerful campaigne of test made over all the general population, getting and reporting-as the figures provided by these countries reflect-a big number of individuals who were positive but asymptomatic, or who had a very good response to the medical treatment. In some cases such as in Korea, since the number of infected persons is not so large, the model shows the changes in trend with greater sensitivity.

This results in a considerable efficiency of the system, especially if done early in the epidemic, and (looking at the results) appears to be the most effective strategy. Early detection (at any stage of the process, but especially at the beginning) and massive testing, together with containment measures to reduce the rate of infection, appear to be the main weapons against the virus. Containment also appears to be an effective tool, but its effectiveness is based on other aspects of the system: it clearly reduces the number of new infections, but this may not affect the survival curve.",

Finally, in Figure 5 , we show the variation of the survival curve of the virus, when computed with different time series of days (50, 70, and 90 days) that provide an idea of the stability of the solutions.

However, as we assume that the medical methods used in all the countries analyzed are similar, this interpretation does not seem to be correct. Instead, it seems to be a consequence of the higher proportion of the population tested in the countries with small slopes: more people start to be followed by the healthcare systems at an early stage in countries such as South Korea or Germany, so the medical prognosis is statistically better. Therefore, of the total population followed in these countries, only a small rate needs medical attention in the late stage, but these patients need it for a long time, so the slope is small.",

It should be stressed that the total number of infected people is not the only parameter to monitor-experience shows that this variable is extraordinarily difficult to control-but that the capacity of healthcare systems to respond to the crisis must also be taken into account and is, in fact, the only relevant information for practical purposes. There is also a technical problem caused by the fact that the data provided by public institutions are not disaggregated, i.e., they give an overall number of new infected people, deaths and cured per day but do not provide the number of days each patient is followed by the health services before being discharged and considered cured. This fact makes it necessary to deconvolute the data to obtain the survival curve using new mathematical procedures, as explained in (3), which inevitably introduce more errors. Analysis using complete data provided by the health administration would also reduce the error caused by this need for mathematical processing. This has been tested in (13).",
