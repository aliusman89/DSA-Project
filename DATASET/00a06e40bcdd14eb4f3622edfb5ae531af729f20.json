            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic introduced significant disruptions and challenges to the learning environment for many post-secondary students with many shifting entirely to remote online learning. Barriers to academic success already experienced in traditional face-to-face classes may be compounded in the online environment and exacerbated by stressors related to the pandemic. In 2020-2021, post-secondary institutions were faced with the reality of rolling out fully online instruction with limited access to resources for assisting students in this transition. Instructional interventions that target students' ability to self-regulate their learning have been shown to improve academic performance and self-regulated learning (SRL) competencies have also been found to mediate the effect of SRL interventions on higher education. However, few studies have examined the efficacy of fully online SRL intervention on mitigating the impact of psychological distress and academic challenges on academic success. This study examined the moderating roles of self-regulatory practices and SRL intervention in buffering the influence of COVID-related psychological distress and academic challenges on academic outcomes (self-reported grade point average (GPA) and academic challenges) in a Canadian sample of undergraduate students (n = 496). We found (a) levels of metacognitive and motivational challenges fully mediated the impact of COVID distress on GPA, (b) SRL adapting practices moderated the impact of metacognitive challenges on GPA, and (c) semester-long SRL intervention buffered the impact of COVID distress on academic challenges and resulted in lower levels of social-emotional, cognitive, and metacognitive challenges for first year undergraduate students.",

            "text": "During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many students faced the additional challenge of transitioning to undergraduate studies delivered fully online by instructors and institutions with limited pedagogical or technological experience delivering fully online instruction. Learning to adapt and respond productively to challenges as they arise during studying is the hallmark of self-regulated learning (SRL). Self-regulating learners are goal directed, optimizing strategy selection and deployment to progress toward goals and adaptively respond to new situations and challenges (Zimmerman, 1989; Winne and Hadwin, 1998; Pintrich and Zusho, 2007) . Theory predicts these students should be well poised to respond to challenges in productive ways that reduce the impact of academic challenges on academic success outcomes such as grade point average (GPA). Extant research examining the academic outcomes and experiences of students who receive SRL support indicates SRL skills and competencies can be taught and developed (Jansen et al., 2019; Theobald, 2021) . However, a limited body of research to date points to the importance of SRL during online learning (e.g., Broadbent and Poon, 2015) . The aim of this study is to examine (a) the role SRL competencies play in mitigating the impact of COVID-19-related psychological distress on academic outcomes, and (b) how SRL competencies and academic challenges differ between students who do and do not receive explicit SRL intervention during a global pandemic where all learning occurred online.",

            "text": "Many factors contribute to academic success. From a selfregulatory perspective, Weinstein and colleagues conceptualized academic success as comprising skill, will and self-regulation (Weinstein, 1994; Weinstein and McCombs, 1998; Weinstein et al., 2000) . Skill refers to having the metacognitive and conditional knowledge about strategies that is necessary to choose and deploy strategies well-suited to the task, context, and learner characteristics. Will focuses on a broad range of motivational and affective constructs involved in directing and sustaining effort and persistence. Self-regulation refers to strategic self-management of cognition and learning, behaviors such as time management and help-seeking, motivational and emotional beliefs and experiences, and metacognitive monitoring and control of strategies themselves (Weinstein et al., 2011) . Numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have collated findings across studies to identify specific psychosocial predictors of academic success and retention (e.g., Robbins et al., 2004; Richardson et al., 2012; Schneider and Preckel, 2017; Saunders-Scott et al., 2018) . Extending the skill, will and self-regulation framework, we posit that psychological predictors of academic success can be loosely organized into five categories: cognitive, motivational, metacognitive, behavioral, and social/emotional factors.",

When learners detect misalignment between goals and progress, they are faced with one of a limited set of options including (a) persist with whatever they were doing and hope it will work better in the future, (b) try a new strategy or approach, (c) adjust or fine tune the strategy, (d) update or change planning in the form of task understanding or goals, or (e) reduce effort or withdraw from the task altogether. Acting in response to detected problems invites a new round of monitoring and evaluating which may in turn lead to continued refinement in approaches. This cyclical process is the essence of strategic and adaptive regulation. Despite the theoretical importance of adaptation and metacognitive control in SRL, student success research has virtually ignored this construct. While metacognitive practices including monitoring, self-evaluation and metacognitive awareness have been found to contribute to academic achievement (e.g., Callan and Cleary, 2019; Colthorpe et al., 2019) , practices associated with adapting learning and strategy choices as the result of monitoring and evaluation have been under-examined (Craig et al., 2020) . Theoretically adaptation practices deployed when strategies and approaches do not work are essential to SRL (Butler and Winne, 1995; Hadwin and Winne, 2012) .",

Students are expected to learn and work quite independently with minimal formal instruction about when, how, or what to study (Hadwin and Winne, 2012) . Even the most successful high school students report facing new kinds of academic challenges at university. Despite extensive research about the factors contributing to student success, there is extant research examining the specific challenges students report during studying. Koivuniemi et al. (2017) used an open-ended questionnaire to collect data about the types of learning challenges and regulatory skills students deploy across different learning situations. The challenges most frequently reported by students included time management, cognitive strategies, concentration, and tiredness. Student with high SRL skills (as measured by the MSLQ) reported a higher frequency of cognitive challenges during individual learning that students ranking low on SRL skills (Pintrich et al., 1993) . Hadwin et al. (2019a,b) examined challenges reported in a weekly study diary over nine consecutive weeks. Students selected from 12 specific challenges including: motivation/procrastination confidence, goal, and time management, choosing or using strategies, learning and remembering, optimizing conditions for studying, language and communication, adjusting to a new culture, emotions, mental health and well-being and life and selfmanagement, or something else. The most frequently reported challenges were motivation and emotion, goal setting and planning, and cognitive challenges. Motivation and emotional challenges were consistently high, regardless of level of goal attainment. Consistent with findings reported by Koivuniemi et al. (2017) , cognitive challenges tended to be more frequently reported among students who were academically successful in terms of attaining goals they set for studying that week.",

Similarly, 60% of the students reported the lack of \"face-to-face\" contact with teachers as the main negative aspect, with 40% reporting difficulty interacting with teachers during the online lessons on the platform. Changes in study context and habits during the shift to online distance education increased the likelihood of poor perceived academic performance by almost four times. However, when attention and memory impairment, COVID anxiety and depression, and satisfaction with distance education were added to the model, changes in the study context and habits was no longer significant. Instead, reporting impairments in attention and concentration during distance education increased the likelihood of perceived poor academic performance by more than 8 times, and high COVID anxiety increased the perception of poor academic performance more than three times. Overall, satisfaction with distance education seemed to serve as a protective factor against perceptions of poor academic performance. Findings from this study were based on a small cross-sectional online convenience sample of university students at one university in Italy.",

Meta-analysis results indicate the effect of SRL interventions on academic achievement is partially mediated by SRL practices (Jansen et al., 2019) . SRL instruction has been found to influence metacognitive and resource management strategy use, with smaller effects on cognitive strategy use (Theobald, 2021) . Evidence suggests SRL interventions improve goal setting and planning strategies before learning as well as self-monitoring during studying, therefore Theobald (2021) recommended that future SRL training and research emphasize the role of metacognitive processes in improving strategy deployment and influences on academic achievement. In addition, Theobald's (2021) meta-analysis revealed limitations in both the range and scope of self-report measured used to examine SRL practices.",

Parameters were estimated with a robust standard error (HC3 method; Davidson and MacKinnon, 1993) to obtain unbiased standard errors under heteroscedasticity. As depicted in The index of moderated mediation was found to be significant (Index = -0.33, BootSE = 0.16, 95% BootCI [-0.65, -0.006]) showing that the full mediated effect between COVID-D and GPA through GPA-P significantly differs across the two groups. Investigating the indirect effects in the model shows that among those who did not receive SRL training, COVID-D had a significant negative indirect effect on GPA through GPA-P (B = -0.4, BootSE = 0.13, 95% BootCI [-0.64, -0.13] ). In contrast, this indirect effect was weaker and non-significant in the SRL training group (B = -0.07, BootSE = 0.11, 95% BootCI [-0.29,0.14]).

This analyses revealed that after controlling for the effect of incoming GPA, students without SRL training had a significantly higher average adjusted mean for the SRL practicemotivation appraisal scale [Mean Difference To summarize, students without SRL training reported higher levels of social-emotional, cognitive, metacognitive, and motivation challenges than students with SRL training.

This finding is consistent with SRL theory which posits that self-regulated learners who are more adaptive fare better in the face of ongoing academic adversities because they can recognize that the acquisition of learning skills requires systematic variations in approaches that will help them overcome learning difficulties (Winne and Hadwin, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008) .

Pandemic-related stressors can exacerbate existing academic challenges particularly among those who struggle to monitor and adapt their learning strategies effectively to changing demands. The enhanced process of selfreflection and adaptive decision-making among self-regulated learners requires a greater understanding and awareness of one's own learning processes, or meta-cognitive ability. While few studies have directly examined SRL practices specifically in the context of adaption, meta-cognitive awareness has been linked to academic performance (e.g., Ward and Butler, 2019) . Consistent with the SRL process model (Zimmerman, 2000) , regular use of forethought (e.g., strategic planning, goal setting) and self-reflection seems to distinguish high achieving from poor achieving students, enabling them to adapt more effectively to shifting contextual changes.",

Specifically, first year students who received SRL training in the course ED-D101: Learning Strategies for University Success reported fewer metacognitive, cognitive, motivational, and socioemotional challenges compared to their counterparts who were not enrolled in the SRL course. Moreover, the intervention moderated the impact of pandemic-related stressors on academic performance since the negative impact of COVID stressors on academic performance was stronger among students who were not enrolled in the SRL course.

SRL interventions have shown efficacy in improving academic performance, in part, through enhancing their knowledge of SRL and engagement in SRL activities (de Bruijn-Smolders et al., 2016; Jansen et al., 2019) . Guiding students to better assess their learning gains, attributing those gains to a specific effective strategy, and systemically applying that strategy to appropriate tasks, optimizes their learning. Moreover, encouraging students to identify and modify strategies that are not working enhances their adaptive ability. The iterative cycle of monitoring tasks and recalibrating strategies is not intuitive for all students particularly under competing demands of academic and social post-secondary life. Compounding such demands with unique circumstances surrounding a global pandemic can further impede students' ability to transfer their self-regulatory abilities across multiple contexts. For example, studying habits that were effective for an in-person learning may not be optimal in a online learning. SRL is contextual and dynamic, requiring learners to regulate their cognition, motivation and emotions during learning tasks that change across different situations (Winne and Hadwin, 2008; Zimmerman, 2008) . Changing tasks and demands introduce new challenges overcomeing these challenges requires learners to successfully adapt and adjust previously learned strategies. During the pandemic, post-secondary students encountered new academic challenges necessitating SRL capacities (e.g., metacognitive awareness); students with fewer SRL skills are less equipped to handle pandemic-related stressors that diminish academic performance. However, our findings suggest that students provided with SRL training were able to moderate the impact of COVID distress on academic performance, mollifying its effect. Providing students with the opportunity to reassess learning approaches and identify specific challenge areas through SRL interventions enables them to strategically direct studying efforts. For example, learning task understanding skills for deciphering specific course content and assigned tasks more accurately is an important predictor of academic performance (Oshige et al., 2007; Hadwin et al., 2008) . Promoting students' awareness of their own learning and guiding them to use higher-quality strategies related to goal setting, strategic planning and self-evaluation can improve student learning outcomes (Colthorpe et al., 2019) . However, it is worth noting that while the SRL intervention group reported fewer academic challenges compared to the non-intervention group, they did not differ significantly in their levels of SRL practices after controlling for incoming GPA (except for motivation appraisal). It may be that the SRL intervention operates through enhancing students' pre-existing SRL skills by helping students apply learning strategies more efficiently and adaptively, thereby mitigating academic challenges.",

            "text": "While the current study offers a more nuanced understanding of how SRL processes mitigate academic challenges in the face of a contextual stressor, such effects are limited to the specific context of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the pandemic provides a unique examination of the unprecedented changes to students' educational environments that are not typical of everyday academic challenges. Individual differences in the SRL skills students' use to overcome these academic challenges can help educators support the transition from varying modes of instruction (e.g., online/blended/in-person settings). Another limitation of the study surrounds the use of selfreports of SRL practices which can be subjected to respondent and recall biases. Moreover, as SRL is a context-dependent process, SRL practices can change depending on that task and goal at hand which may not be accurately captured in traditional self-reported inventories. Nonetheless, self-report still provides valuable insights into learner's motivation processes and perceptions of how they monitor, set goals, and adapt effectively particularly if measures are sensitive to time and task (McCardle and Hadwin, 2015) . More research may benefit from using objective measures of SRL practices to discern the frequency and quality of these skills (e.g., Winne, 2010) . Lastly, it is important to acknowledge limits to the design of the study. Specifically, participants were not randomly assigned to the intervention condition, which limits the comparability across groups. As group comparisons were only permitted among first year students in the analysis (i.e., to match the samples), such truncation significantly reduced the sample size. Without a true randomized control trial (RCT) design with pre-test and post-test differences in both groups, findings regarding the effectiveness of the intervention should be viewed with caution. RCTs of SRL interventions are needed to systematically evaluate its impact on student success.",

These challenges both have inverse effects on GPA prediction. The inverse effect indicates higher levels of challenge were associated with lower GPA prediction [B Metacognition = -0.12, t(457) = -2.61, p = 0.009 | B Motivation = -0.11, t(457) = -2.47, p = 0.014].

Further analysis of conditional effects of the metacognitive challenges at values of the adaptation practices showed that the inverse indirect impact of COVID-D on GPA-P is stronger for students who practiced less adaptation. To elaborate, while this effect is significant at 1 standard deviation below adaptation average [B = -0.19, t(457) = -3.53, p = 0.0005], it is less strong at the adaption average value [B = -0.12, t(457) = -2.6, p = 0.009], and less strong and non-significant at 1 standard deviation above the adaptation average [B = -0.05, t(457) = -0.89, p = 0.37]. The index of moderated mediation (difference between conditional indirect effects, seeHayes, 2015) was also significant (Index = 0.026, BootSE = 012, 95% BootCI [0.003, 0.52]) indicating higher versus lower levels of adaptation practices produce a differential effect on the indirect effect of COVID-D on GPA-P through metacognitive challenges. Follow up Johnson-Neyman significance region(s) analysis showed that the effect is significant for adaptation values falling above 61 percentiles.Finally, GPA-P was shown to have a strong direct influence on GPA [B = 1.6, t(458) = 19.23, p < 0.001]. COVID-D was found to have no significant direct effect (c') on GPA [B = 0.07, t(458) = 0.104, p = 0.30]. Analysis of indirect effects showed that motivation and metacognitive challenges fully mediated the effect of COVID-D on GPA-P, making the direct link between COVID-D and GPA-P insignificant [B = -0.03, t(457) = -0.75, p = 0.45]. Also, COVID-D was found to have no significant indirect effect on GPA through motivation challenges (B = -0.026, BootSE = 0.019, 95% BootCI [-0.065,0.01]), metacognition challenges (B = -0.01, BootSE = 0.02, 95% BootCI TABLE 2 | Intercorrelations for study variables (N = 463).

Conditional effects of the COVID-D across two groups indicate that COVID-D negatively affected students' GPA predictions in the group with no SRL training [B = -0.32, t(152) = -3.6, p < 0.001] but such an effect was not observed in the group that had received SRL training [B = -0.06, t(52) = -0.69, p = 0.5]. Consistent with the results of the previous model, GPA-P had a strong positive influence on GPA [B = 1.26, t(153) = 7.6, p < 0.001]. The direct path in the model (C') is not significant [B = 0.05, t(153) = 0.33, p = 0.74] meaning that COVID-D impacts GPA only indirectly through mediation of GPA-P in the model [F(2,153) = 37.13, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.27].",
