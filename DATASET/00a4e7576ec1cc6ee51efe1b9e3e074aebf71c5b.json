            "text": "Contact tracing has been proven an effective approach to control the virus spread in pandemics like COVID-19 pandemic. As an emerging powerful decentralized technique, blockchain has been explored to ensure data privacy and security in contact tracing processes. However, existing works are mostly high-level designs with no sufficient demonstration and treat blockchain as separate storage system assisting third-party central servers, ignoring the importance and capability of consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism. In this paper, we propose a light-weight and fully third-party free Blockchain-Driven Contact Tracing framework (BDCT) to bridge the gap. In the BDCT framework, RSA encryption based transaction verification method (RSA-TVM) is proposed to ensure contact tracing correctness, which can achieve more than 96% contact cases recording accuracy even each person has 60% probability of failing to verify the contact information. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stake (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism is proposed together with the incentive mechanism, which can ensure timeliness of reporting contact cases and keep blockchain decentralized. A novel contact tracing simulation environment is created, which considers three different contact scenarios based on population density. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness and attack resistance of RSA-TVM and RC-DPoS in the proposed BDCT.",

Some technology companies also developed contact tracing tools, such as Google and Apple developed a Bluetoothbased API that can be used by third parties to develop smart phone apps [5] . These apps mostly use Bluetooth to recognize nearby devices or GPS signal to get the accurate location coordinates to determine contact cases.

Authors assume there are plenty of users in the system behaving honestly, while the situation is hard to achieve in practice. Xu et al.

The 4 challenges are overlapped with each other: 1) Instead of simply treating blockchain as a separated storage method, how to leverage powerful consensus mechanism in blockchain system to promote data security; 2) How to design an effective consensus mechanism to organize data storage and meanwhile achieve low latency of recording contact information. The popular consensus mechanisms are usually too computational expensive for mobile devices, and may bring significant delay of recording contact information. People should be able to access latest contact records timely to prevent further possible virus spread. 3) How to design the incentive mechanism so that people are motivated to join the contact tracing system and behaviour honestly. 4) Due to lack of real-world contact data, as well as high cost of testing whole system in practice, it is hard to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of whole systems. The difficulty of collecting real-world contact information, is not only from privacy concerns, but also diversity of people contact scenarios. Contact cases happened in crowded cities and those happened in rural areas are totally different scenarios with different frequencies and amounts. This diversity brings challenge to design incentive mechanism fair to every one.",

In addition, according to the survey conducted at multiple countries in [9] , though most people accept app-based tracing methods, the concern about the security and privacy is still an obstacle to the common adoption of tracing apps in many countries. Therefore, in this article, we aim to tackle the 4 challenges with the users' privacy ensured by proposing a fully third-party free contact tracing framework with blockchain technology. A RSA based transaction verification algorithm is proposed to ensure the correctness of recorded contact information and improve system robustness. To efficiently store contact information into blocks, we propose Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stake (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism, which can control the right of appending new blocks. An incentive mechanism is then designed to work with RC-DPoS motivating people to work honestly and maintaining system decentrality. Finally, we design a contact tracing simulation method that simulates different real-world people contact scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of proposed framework.",

However, the trace build is not practical since most people don not answer phones calls very frequently during a day, therefore we can only get limited number of locations. The contact tracing system based on GPS signal are not reliable for in-door situations, while in-door contact is one major way of virus spread due to short contact distance and long contact time. Some work proposes to use WiFi or wireless access points to discover contact cases [10] , [11] , [13] . These frameworks require users to connect their devices to specific wireless access points. However, in some public areas such as shopping malls, airports and train stations, people may not join public WiFi due to network security concerns. Bluetooth technology can scan nearby devices and get device identities within a small range, which can help generate the contact cases [15] . In this article, we also leverage this advantage to protect users privacy that avoids disclosing users' real identities and specific locations.",

A blockchain system usually constructs a peer-to-peer network, where each user plays exactly the same role and follows the same protocol. Every user stores a whole copy of blockchain, so that all the data on the blockchain are extremely hard to be tempered and single-point failure can naturally be avoided. There's no need of a central server to perform functions in the system, such as collecting, computing or storing data. Users (peers) in a blockchain system have equal rights to perform functionalities by executing smart contracts deployed in the system. A consensus mechanism is enforced in the system to control which user is qualified to generate a new block at each step. An incentive mechanism is also important in the system to motivate users to compete for the right of generating a block.",

Figure 4(c) shows the Gini coefficient of balance of baseline DPoS remains as high as 0.56 when blockchain height is 10k, indicating the stake rewards are mostly given to people in Dense scenario. Since the baseline DPoS mechanism does not consider any credit reward, therefore the Gini coefficient of credit is 0 in Figure 4 (a)(c). In addition The Gini coefficient of mined blocks count of baseline is close to 0, this is because under the random vote strategy in DPoS, users has the same expectation to be selected as a miner. Figure 4 (b) and (d) shows the results of our proposed BDCT framework. In Figure 4 (b), our BDCT framework makes the gini coefficient decrease with the height of blockchain, which means BDCT is achieving balanced stake reward when we continue recording more data. In Figure 4(d) , as expected, the Gini coefficient of credit is 0.57 when blockchain height is 10k, showing users in dense area can indeed earn more credit than other users. The Gini coefficient of mined blocks count is 0.27 which is higher than 0.12 in baseline, indicating people in dense areas indeed have higher chance to be a miner.

It can be seen that our framework lost significantly less contact cases than baseline at any failure rate p. BDCT can correctly record nearly 96.31% (1-3.69%) total contact cases even every node has 0.6 failure probability, which is 35% more than the baseline that can only preserve about 61.26% (1-38.74%) contact cases.",

In each contact list C or witness list W , there are signed tuples (u iP ub key , SD ui P ri key ). The size of signed tuples is denoted as s st . In our experiments, we generate 1024 bits RSA Keys with the Python package Crypto 4 . With the secret message as 10 Hex characters, s st = 56 bytes + 161 bytes = 217 bytes in our simulation.",

We propose the role \"witness\" in the framework to promote contact tracing data integrity, and the RSA based Transaction Verification Method (RSA-TVM) to verify the correctness of the reported contact cases. Reputation Corrected Delegated Proof of Stake (RC-DPoS) consensus mechanism is applied to select miners based on both users' reputation and users' stake. An incentive mechanism is further developed to motivate people to keep reporting contact cases honestly and work with RC-DPoS achieving balanced stake reward distribution to maintain the whole framework decentralized. In the simulation, we propose a simulation environment, which mixes three contact scenarios based on different population density. The simulation results demonstrate our proposed framework can achieve significantly decentrality than the baseline framework, and RSA-TVM incorporated with \"witness\" role in the framework can hugely improve the system robustness.",

In BDCT, though the computation cost is eliminated and storage cost is considered acceptable, the communication cost is still high for circulating contact transactions among devices to get contact cases verified especially when contact cases are tremendous. Synchronizing blockchain and shared transaction pool also imposes communication stress on smart devices. Therefore a better communication protocol is highly demanded for making more scalable contact tracing applications.",

Similarly, E(S T M/h ) \u2264 3374 bytes and E(S T C/h ) \u2264 36227 bytes. Hence E(S T /h ) \u2264 306 + 3374 + 36227 = 39907 bytes. Then E(S T B/h ) = E(N B/h ) * s BH + E(S T /h ) = 12 * 78 + 39907 bytes = 40843 bytes \u2248 39.89 KB. Therefore the expected storage cost for the blockchain generated per day is 24 * E(S T /h ) = 24 * 39.89 KB = 957.36 KB < 1M B, which is totally affordable for most smart devices.",
