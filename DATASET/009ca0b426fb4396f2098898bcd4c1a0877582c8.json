VDR-bound enhancers are shaded in grey and non-ligand-dependent TSS regions in blue. The type of VDR binding sites at enhancers is indicated as transient (T) or 24 h only (24) [28] . These data are compared with ChIP-seq results obtained under the same conditions for histone markers of active chromatin (H3K27ac, green) [35] and active TSS regions (H3K4me3, purple) [35] as well as with FAIRE-seq data (turquoise) [29] . The peak tracks display merged data from the three biological repeats. Gene structures are shown in blue and the vitamin D target genes FN1 (A) and LILRB4 (B) are highlighted in red. The genomic regions 1 Mb up-and downstream of the gene's TSS were inspected but only the areas relevant for 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -dependent regulation are displayed. Figure A3 .
