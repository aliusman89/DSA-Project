The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up assessed by three-dimensional echocardiography. Secondary endpoints included the change in left ventricular end-systolic (LVESV) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Cardiac performance was evaluated by the force-frequency relationship as assessed by the slope change of the cardiac contractility index (CCI = systolic blood pressure/LVESV index) at 70, 90, and 110 beats of biventricular pacing. A total of 75 patients were randomized to FCM (n = 37) or SOC (n = 38). At baseline, both treatment groups were well matched including baseline LVEF (34 \u00b1 7 vs. 33 \u00b1 8, P = 0.411). After 3 months, the change in LVEF was significantly higher in the FMC group [\u00fe4.22%, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u00fe3.05%; \u00fe5.38%] than in the SOC group (-0.23%, 95% CI -1.44%; \u00fe0.97%; P < 0.001). Similarly, LVESV (-9.72 mL, 95% CI -13.5 mL; -5.93 mL vs. -1.83 mL, 95% CI -5.7 mL; 2.1 mL; P = 0.001), but not LVEDV (P = 0.748), improved in the FCM vs. the SOC group. At baseline, both treatment groups demonstrated a negative force-frequency relationship, as defined by a decrease in CCI at higher heart rates (negative slope). FCM resulted in an improvement in the CCI slope during incremental biventricular pacing, with a positive force-frequency relationship at 3 months. Functional status and exercise capacity, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire and peak oxygen consumption, were improved by FCM.",

The IRON-CRT trial (Effect of Intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose on Reverse Remodelling Following Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) was a prospective, double-blind randomized multi-centre trial specifically designed to determine if treatment with FCM (i) induces incremental reverse remodelling in CRT patients with iron deficiency and a persistently reduced LVEF and (ii) is capable of improving the force-frequency relationship in HFrEF.",

The aim of the IRON-CRT trial was to assess the impact of intravenous FCM compared to placebo on cardiac reverse remodelling and cardiac contractile status in HFrEF patients with iron deficiency who experienced incomplete reverse remodelling at least 6 months after CRT. If patients sufficed all inclusion and exclusion criteria and provided written informed consent, patients were randomized using a web-based randomization system (Castor EDC).",

Because the maximal allowed dose of FCM during one intravenous administration is 1000 mg per week, patients who required a dose of either 1500 or 2000 mg received a follow-up appointment after 1-2 weeks to receive the remaining dose. To assure maximal blinding, patients assigned to the placebo group who would also require an additional dose based on their body weight and haemoglobin levels also received a second dosing appointment with the infusion of placebo at that time. As the collection of the endpoints in this study occur on a relative short basis (3 months), no additional maintenance doses of FCM were administered. Because FCM is a darkbrown solution, additional measures were undertaken to assure patient and investigator blinding. 14, 16, 18 Both the placebo and FCM solutions were covered in non-see-through white bags. In addition, all infusion lines were made of non-see-through white plastic, avoiding the detection of the colour of the infusate (Supplementary material online, Figure S1 ). A study member from the Clinical Trial Unit (CTU) of the Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg (Genk, Belgium), not involved in endpoint assessment, was unblinded and responsible for randomization, preparation, and administration of the blinded study infusate (FCM of placebo).

            "text": "The objective of this study was to determine if treatment with FCM (i) induces incremental reverse remodelling and (ii) is capable of improving cardiac contractile function. The primary endpoint was the change in LVEF from baseline to 3-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints of reverse remodelling were the change from baseline in left ventricular endsystolic (LVESV) and end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) to 3 months. LVEF, LVEDV, and LVESV were measured using three-dimensional (3D) transthoracic echocardiography by an experienced blinded sonographer to alleviate inter-observer variability (one observer) and minimize intraobserver variability (3D echocardiography). 19 The second objective of this study was to determine if FCM treatment is capable of improving cardiac contractility by assessing the force-frequency relationship. The gold standard for measuring the force-frequency relationship is by plotting invasively measured contractility against heart rate. Previous studies however have used a non-invasive surrogate (cardiac contractility index, CCI). 8, 20 This CCI is the ratio between systolic blood pressure divided by LVESV index (LVESV/body surface area). To determine the force-frequency relationship, all patients underwent a previously validated pacing protocol. 8, 9 A detailed description of all echocardiographic measurements and this pacing protocol can be found in the Supplementary material online, methods. Briefly, patients underwent biventricular pacing in DDD mode (or VVI in case of atrial fibrillation) at different lower rates of pacing (70, 90, and 110 b.p.m.). The lower rate was first programmed to 70 b.p.m. After a 5-min adaptation period in decubitus, blood pressure measurements (the arm with the highest pressure) were repeated three times and averaged. Patients were then positioned in left lateral decubitus, and after a 5-min adaptation period, echocardiographic measurements were taken to calculate the CCI. The R-mode of the CRT device was programmed off during this image protocol to avoid movement inducing surges in heart rate above the programmed lower rate. This protocol was afterward repeated for a pacing rate of 90 and 110 b.p.m. The impact of FCM on cardiac performance was assessed as the change in the slope of CCI at different heart rates (force-frequency relationship), with a negative slope indicating a negative force-frequency relationship and a positive slope a positive relationship.",

The sample size calculation was based on a previous study illustrating in 40 patients (n = 20 iron sucrose) a mean improvement in LVEF of 4.4% in favour of iron sucrose. 21 Considering a type I error rate a = 0.05 and a type II error rate b = 0.10 (statistical power of 90%), we calculated a total sample size of 66 patients to detect a mean 2.4% difference in LVEF, using a 3% absolute difference in LVEF standard deviation. In addition, to account for potential drop-out and to allow for more power for the secondary endpoint of forcefrequency relationship, the sample size was rounded to 100 patients. Due to poor enrolment in one of the centres (no patients were enrolled at Jessa Hospital as this site was activated just before the COVID-19 pandemic), it was decided to close the study prematurely at 75 patients in December 2020. Because only three patients were lost to follow-up, this was well above the calculated sample size of 66 patients. Data analysis for the efficacy endpoints were assessed for a full analysis set (FAS). The FAS consists of patients randomly assigned to treatment that received trial medication and had at least one post-baseline assessment. Because three patients died (all in the SOC group) before the post-baseline assessment, these patients were excluded from this analysis. As predefined in the analysis plan, the effect of missing data on the primary endpoint was assessed in a sensitivity analysis. Missing not at random imputation was done by creating control-based pattern imputation (regression model created using baseline age, gender and baseline LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV). 9 The change in primary (LVEF), secondary (LVESV and LVEDV) and tertiary endpoints (peakVO 2 , V E /V CO2 , KCCQ, and NT-proBNP) from baseline to 3-month follow-up were assessed using analysis of covariance adjusted for the baseline value. Squared transformation was performed in case of none normal distributions. The force-frequency relationship was assessed using linear mixed models including a fixed effect of randomization group, heart rate (linear assumption), time (baseline or follow-up), and an interaction term of the aforementioned fixed effects. Categorical safety endpoints and investigator reported adverse events were assessed at 3 months using Fisher's exact test. Risk differences were calculated and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the Clopper-Pearson method. Predefined subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint were performed without correction for multiple testing. Categorical baseline values were reported as numbers and percentages and group difference tested with Fisher's exact test. Continuous variables were reported as mean \u00b1 standard deviation if normally distributed or medians and 25-75th interquartile range, with group difference testing using chisquare or Mann-Whitney U-test when appropriate. Correlations were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient. All analyses were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A twosided P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analysis.",

The least square mean (LSM) change from baseline to 3-month follow-up in LVEF, LVESV, and LVEDV is shown in Figure 2 . After 3 months, the LSM change in LVEF from baseline was significantly higher in the FCM group (\u00fe4.22%, 95% CI \u00fe3.05%; 5.38%) compared to the SOC group (-0.23%, 95% CI -1.44%; \u00fe0.97%, P < 0.001). Similarly, in the predefined sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of missing data (n = 3), treatment with FCM resulted in more improvement of LVEF after 3 months (P < 0.001). In addition, the LSM change in LVESV from baseline to follow-up was more pronounced in the FCM group vs. the SOC group (-9.72 mL, 95% CI -13.5 mL; -5.93 vs. -1.83 mL, 95% CI -5.7 mL; Effect on the force-frequency relationship Table S4 ). Figure 4 illustrates the change in tertiary endpoints between the two treatment groups. At baseline, peak VO 2 was similar in both groups. After 3 months, the LSM change in peak VO 2 and was not associated with a higher risk for adverse events ( Table 2) . Dose and percentage of patients taking neurohormonal blockers did not change during the study. Figure 5 illustrates the results of the three predefined subgroup analyses. In all three subgroups, FCM resulted in a significantly higher (all P < 0.05) improvement in LVEF in comparison to SOC. Testing for interaction showed that the subgroup of patients with TSAT > _20% had less improvement in LVEF than patients with a TSAT of <20% (P-value for interaction = 0.0362); however, both subgroups still demonstrated an improvement in LVEF in comparison to the SOC subgroup (LSM difference FCM vs. SOC, TSAT > _20%: 2.15 [0.15-4.14], P = 0.0363; TSAT <20%: 5.58 [3.60-7.56], P < 0.001).

Persistent left ventricular dysfunction and symptomatic disease is present in up to 30% of CRT recipients. 32 We are the first to demonstrate in this doubleblind trial that treatment of iron deficiency with FCM results in an improvement of LVEF (LSM change \u00fe4.22%), reduces LVESV, and improves functional status as measured by the KCCQ and exercise capacity measured by peak VO 2 . By nature, randomized controlled trials are capable of answering the question of causality, hereby showing that FCM offers incremental reverse remodelling. Importantly, although all patients were on guideline-recommended optimal medical treatment consisting of neurohormonal blockers-including 50% on angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor-and CRT, they remained to have symptomatic severe heart failure with cardiac remodelling as defined by their NYHA class, LVEF, left ventricular volumes, and NT-proBNP. Because we selected heart failure patients with a persistently reduced LVEF after CRT implant, we are not able to answer the question whether iron deficiency should be treated before CRT implant. Nevertheless, iron-deficient heart failure patients with a guideline indication for CRT (by nature of selection) also have a guideline indication for treatment with FCM. 12 Although we specifically targeted an HFrEF population demonstrating persistent heart failure progression despite current guideline-recommended device and medical therapy, there is no reason to believe that FCM would not have similar effects in other iron-deficient HFrEF patients.",

A potential reason might be the fact that all our patients had a CRT device and that rate adaptive pacing with a high upper rate was provided if necessary, thereby overcoming chronotropic incompetence.",

            "text": "Finally, we did not find a statistical interaction between the treatment effect of FCM and the presence of anaemia or a lower or higher baseline LVEF. Although guidelines position FCM for the treatment of symptomatic iron-deficient HFrE, defined as LVEF <40%, our study is consistent with the CONFIRM-HF and AFFIRM-AHF trials in showing no significant interaction if LVEF was above 40%, suggesting that FCM works equally well in patients with an LVEF 40-45%. 13, 18 Similarly to the meta-analysis of Anker et al., 33 we did observe significant interaction between the treatment effect of FCM and the presence of a high TSAT > _20% (also referred to as patients with isolated hypoferritinaemia). While these patients still had an improvement in LVEF, the effect was less pronounced than if TSAT was <20%. Nevertheless, the recent AFFIRM-AHF trial (the largest published trial to date with FCM in heart failure) did not observe a treatment interaction with low or high TSAT, showing that the effect of FCM on endpoints such as heart failure hospitalization is perhaps more than just an improvement in LVEF or cardiac contractility but also relates to the effects of FCM on peripheral muscles and global heart failure status. 13, 24, 27 Limitations Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, we used 3D echocardiography and not magnetic resonance imaging to determine LVEF and left ventricular volumes because all patients had a CRT. Nevertheless, 3D echocardiography has shown excellent correlation with magnetic resonance measurements of LVEF and left ventricular volumes. The semi-automated algorithms used offer high reproducibility and low test-retest variability. Studies have shown that the source of the largest variability between 3D echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging stems from poor image quality. 34 Therefore, to optimize the accuracy of our analysis, poor twodimensional image quality on screening evaluation was an exclusion criteria. Second, we did not invasively measure cardiac contractility during incremental pacing. Third, we studied CRT patients to determine changes in the force-frequency relationship; therefore, results might not apply to all HFrEF patients. Fourth, the sample size is relatively small compared to other trials with FCM. Fifth, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no patients were included from the Jessa Hospital. As such, the generated results might not be applicable to broader range of practice settings.",
