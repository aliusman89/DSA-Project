Accelerating change is likely to contain both good and bad elements and elements that are too rapid to quickly assimilate and socialize. Figure 5 .1 suffers from one problem: the arrow of change and the axes give the impression of smooth change. The changes in humans, the noosphere and the technium are expected to be anything but smooth. There will be increases in each, but also increases in the number and types of categories in each. These axes each therefore represent a multiplicity of dimensions, meaning that the arrow of change will actually be a jagged path through multiple dimensions. Accompanying the changes will be changes in scale, connectivity, complexity, and the impact of randomness. As the changes grow, multiple paradigm shifts can be expected.",

From the technical vantage point, the work of O'Toole with multiple distributed detectors is a helpful start.

This approach has had some successes, but has undergone periods of disfavor.

Seabrook reported that the \"compute\" (the complete ability to do computing) is growing faster than the \"rate suggested by Moore's Law, which holds that the processing power of computers doubles every two years. Innovations in chip design, network architecture, and cloud-based resources are making the total available compute ten times larger each year (Seabrook, 2019).\" Figure 5 .3 illustrates the construction of one type of artificial neural net. The intent is to replicate the ability of humans to recognize something, given an input set. The input set entries are fed to a series of nodes in the first layer, here labeled 01 through 09. Each of these nodes passes its data to each of the nodes in the second layer (sometimes called the hidden layer), here labeled 11 through 19. Each node in the second layer applies a weight to the input it receives, potentially different for each source and combines the inputs using some function, such as the weighted average. Each node of the second layer passes its results to the third layer, here labeled 21 through 29. Each node in the third layer applies a weight to the input it receives, potentially different for each source and combines the inputs using some function, such as the weighted average. The results from the third layer comprise the output of the artificial neural net, weighted by source. (Note that the connections in the figure are only partially illustrated. Note also, that the outputs from a node in one layer need not connect to all the nodes in the next layer or might have a zero weighting.)",

AI is not there yet. Hawkins and Blakeslee wrote On Intelligence, with a chapter on how the cortex works (Hawkins & Blakeslee, 2004). Several points are directly pertinent to our discussion here. First, the brain uses similar internal structures (generally in different parts of the brain) to classify sensory input of all types. For example, the pixel-like inputs from the eyes are classified into images and the letters of words and the frequency-based inputs from the ears are classified into phonemes and words using the same hardware (well, wetware) and algorithms. It also uses the same structures to learn how to do the classification. The primitive hierarchical structure is the neural net with real neurons. However, as Hawkins and Blakeslee explained, the actual neural processing is more sophisticated, hierarchical in fact. The layers are critical in subdividing the work. Early layers do things like detecting edges. Later layers identify letters. Final layers work on putting things together. There are many complexities, such as using feedback from upper layers to lower layers to supply predictions for what may be coming next. However, the point is that the structure of the brain works. Deep learning has added more hierarchical processing. Moreover, the evidence of the brain's use of the same structure for multiple things implies that deep learning will have many applications.

Absent flaws in the underlying computer system, AI and other computer programs do exactly what they are told to do, no more and no less. It is a human responsibility to decide what to tell them to do. On the other hand, Rodrick Wallace argued that ambitious plans for AI dominated systems will face problems having levels of subtlety and ubiquity unimagined by the purveyors of the plans. His title, Carl von Clausewitz, the Fog-of-War, and the AI Revolution: The Real World Is Not A Game Of Go, expressed his thesis (Wallace, 2018). The problem of defeating human masters at chess was difficult. Winning at Go was regarded as much more difficult, yet an AI system was built that did just that. However, Wallace argued that the real world is so much more complex than Go that this achievement, while real, is not dispositive. As he saw it, the Fog-of-War problem described by Clausewitz has not been solved by humans and will afflict AI systems as well. In fact, he said, \"We argue here that, in the real world, Artificial Intelligence will face similar challenges with similar or greater ineptitude.\" Wallace discussed this in mathematical terms in the body of the book, showing why he drew such an extraordinary conclusion. He might describe the AI bounded reality problem as the difficulty for AI to see reality at all.",

The distant person doesn't generally have other connections that receive the message at the same (or nearly the same) time and so does not receive reinforcement, resulting in no conversion. Complex things spread (mostly) through the strong connections, often in geographically contiguous areas, because the people connected by strong connections are connected to others who have strong connections to multiple sources (Fig. 5.6) . In this example, two sources are required for a node to embrace the behavior (or contract the disease). Nodes 22 and 23 are the initial sources (marked with the \"1\" identifier). Because the network connections do not connect all nearest neighbors in this network, node 13 is infected in stage 2, but other close nodes, like node 14 are not infected. However, in stage 3, node 14 has two infected neighbors (node 13 and node 23) and is infected. Similarly, node 24 is not infected until stage 4. After four stages, less than half the network is infected. Note that node 18 has not been infected, despite its connection to node 22-node 18 has only one infected connection through stage 4. This is the reason that behavior changes spread more slowly than ideas and generally diffuse as if they were tied to the geography.

On the other hand, a loosely coupled management style is one that tolerates and encourages self-organizing informal networks, similar to the social networks of Ferguson. Atkinson and Moffat compared the effectiveness of the two management styles in times of stability and in times of turbulence: the tightly coupled style provides better results in the first and the more loosely coupled style works better in the second. In either case, the styles can be described by choice of network type (a traditional hierarchy being a particular type of network). Note, ours is certainly not an age of stability! In describing agility, Atkinson and Moffat concentrated on times of lesser stability because in times of high stability, agility is not required-it may even be a negative, frictional factor. They started by defining one measure of system agility as the number of states or condition available in a system. Clearly, the management agility should correspond to the system agility. Management agility will be determined by the range of management actions that are available. As they saw it, the Information Age recommends increases in agility-and generally requires it. They saw a need for both the formal structures of a flexible hierarchy and the self-organized informal networks and the need for both to work together (Atkinson & Moffat, 2005b).",

            "text": "\u2022 The first entry in the table declares that different laws of physics apply at different scales. The macroworld has no concept that corresponds to the identicality of all electrons. They can be in different states, but otherwise they are all the same! \"For an electron bound in an atom these states are specified by a set of numbers, called 'quantum numbers.' Four quantum numbers specify a state, and that's it-nothing else.\" The four quantum numbers are energy, angular momentum, magnetic moment, and spin. Each quantum number can take on only discrete sets of integers or half-integers. There are two categories of identical particles. Fermions obey the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which says that no two identical fermions (such as electrons) can occupy the same quantum state. Fermions can't be \"mashed together.\" (Pauli was given the Nobel Prize for this result.) Bosons (e.g., photons) can be \"mashed together.\" In fact, a sufficient number mashed together become a Bose-Einstein condensate-a classical wave. Liquid helium, with its strange properties, provides a visible example in which helium atoms act like bosons. \u2022 The second entry refers to the concept that in the classical world, each thing has a \"definite identity and is located at a specific place at a specific time\"-ghosts and phantoms to not appear do not \"pop up and disappear unpredictably.\" In the quantum world, pairs of particles and anti-particles do pop up and disappear unpredictably and things can act like waves or particles and thus must be regarded as having dual natures. \u2022 The classical world is imagined to be constructed of or described by three physical dimensions and a single time dimension, each continuous. In a continuous dimension, between any two points there is always another point-there are no gaps. The quantum world is defined by gaps: electrons jump (or fall) from one energy level to another, with nothing in between. [At this point there is no evidence that time or space is quantized, fundamentally discontinuous; however, many variables that can be expressed as being continuous in the classical world are discrete in the quantum world.] \u2022 In the classical world, uncertainty is \"epistemological uncertainty-uncertainty in what we know about the objects of study.\" In the quantum world, \"ontological uncertainty or uncertainty in nature itself\" is added. Thus, things are deterministic in the classical world, even though we cannot precisely measure them. But in the quantum world there exist things that cannot be determined, such as simultaneous exact knowledge of position and momentum-Heisenberg uncertainty. \u2022 One of the clearest breaks between the classical world and the quantum world lies in the realm of causality. The classical world is based on causality-if something happens, something caused it. In the quantum world, some things just happen-a radioactive atom decays or not; a light wave reflects or refracts. The best you can do is determine a probability of occurrence. \u2022 The most disturbing difference lies in the significance of the observer. In the classical world, an observer can interfere with an effect-the measuring instrument might be too obtrusive. However, successively finer instruments would reduce the interference and measuring the successive changes might allow for accounting for the interference. In the quantum world, the effect may not occur until it is observed! Schroedinger's cat provides the familiar example. The cat is neither dead nor alive, but is has the two states superposed until the box is opened and the state observed.",

Since that time, the concept has been adapted and adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense, the European Space Agency, and finally established as an ISO standard in 2013.",

Figure 5 .7, adapted from the forum report, shows the funding gap in the Valley of Death in terms TRLs. Essentially the problem is that early stages of research and development of concepts can often find funding from the government or universities and late stage implementation funding of some technologies is provided by the private sector.",
