            "text": "Emerging RNA viruses are a global health concern due to their potentially high transmission rate, high mutation rates, and aggressive competition to host cellular functions. As a result of SARS-CoV-2 mutation dynamics, several variants of concern have emerged, of which there is evidence of increased transmission, more severe disease outcomes, and/or evidence of decreased neutralization by antibodies raised against previous infection or vaccine [7] . In particular, amino acid replacements in the spike protein can lead to enhanced binding with the host ACE2 receptor causing increased transmissibility and potentially higher virulence [8, 5] . Similar to influenza A virus and, to a lesser extent, seasonal human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be expected to accumulate adaptive amino acid replacements in its glycoprotein, resulting in antigenic drift [9] . However, due to the biological differences in influenza A virus (IAV) (which is a segmented negative-stranded RNA virus with a higher overall evolutionary rate compared to coronaviruses) and seasonal coronaviruses, (which have been circulating among the human population for a long time), genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to detect and assess the effect of such mutations [9] . The global effort for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing has led to efficient tracking of circulating lineages as well as tracking of mutations that may lead to changes in vaccine efficacy, PCR detection, and virus transmissibility [10, 11] . Therefore, surveying the molecular epidemiology/spatiotemporal changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and understanding its mutations are important. Yet, there is a significant underrepresentation of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from middle-and low-income countries in the global dataset [12] .",

The samples were analyzed with STAT-NAT COVID-19 MULTI real-time PCR kits (Sentinel, Milano, Italy), based on two targets in RdRP and Orf1b genes, to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The real-time PCR assay was conducted using the Mx3000P qPCR system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany).

It has been reported [34] that this accessory protein modulates the immune response of the host by binding with the host lymphocyte function-associated antigen I (LFA-1). Previous studies have suggested that the amino acids T39, E41, N43, Q62, A66, and K72 play a key role in the function of ORF7a [34] . Among these six active residues, two (A66 and K72) were truncated by a premature stop codon. Therefore, to predict the potential effect of the stop codon (Q62*) on the function of the ORF7a protein, we constructed a 3D model of the mutant ORF7a. The crystal structure of ORF7a (PDB: 7ci3) was used as the template. The similarity and dissimilarity between the selected template and model were performed using TM-align and FATCAT, where the optimal structural similarity was evaluated based on the obtained TM score (0.70, TM-score > 0.5, indicating that the two proteins have the same fold). A flexible protein structure comparison between the model and template was achieved using FATCAT, where the obtained p-value (1.55e-15) and RMSD (0.06 \u212b) indicate that the two protein structures are significantly similar. After validation, quality check, adding polar hydrogen atoms, and adding Gasteiger charge of the selected model, it was then subjected to molecular docking alongside the wild ORF7a to assess the protein-protein interaction of ORF7a and LFA-1 Idomain (pdb: 7ci3). The latter is located on the cell membrane of human leukocytes, which is the target of ORF7a ( Figure 5 ). The molecular docking results suggested that there was no significant difference in the binding affinity of the mutant and wild ORF7a, and the HADDOCK scores were -67.0 and -63.6 for mutant and wild ORF7a, respectively ( Table 1) .

It has been reported that the deletion 69-70 in the S protein causes a negative result from RT-PCR assays specific target for S-gene [38] . This specific deletion has occurred at high frequency in different countries and is currently geographically widespread. According to our results, this deletion was identified in 53 strains among 60 of the Alpha variant ( Figure 4 ). In addition to this deletion, a cluster of aa mutations (Y144del, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H) were noticed in the spike proteins of the strains belonging to the Alpha variant (Supplementary Table S2 ).

This motivated us to use an in silico approach to investigate the effect of Q62* on the function of NS7a using molecular docking scores ( Table 1 ). The results predicted that NS7a was still able to bind to its target (LFA-1). Consistently, some strains with Q62* were derived from patients with severe infections, suggesting that truncated NS7a may not reduce the pathogenicity of the virus. However, further studies on the functional consequences of the stop codon Q62* are required to confirm this finding.",
