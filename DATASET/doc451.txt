Article Summary: SARS-CoV-2 has similar replication kinetics to SARS-CoV, but demonstrates significant sensitivity to type I interferon treatment.
Abstract 1 SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus (CoV), has recently emerged causing an ongoing outbreak of 2 viral pneumonia around the world. While genetically distinct from the original SARS-CoV, both 3 group 2B coronaviruses share similar genome organization and origins to coronaviruses 4 harbored in bats. Importantly, initial guidance has used insights from SARS-CoV infection to 5 inform treatment and public health strategies. In this report, we evaluate SARS-CoV-2 relative to 6 the original SARS-CoV. Our results indicate that while SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral 7 replication kinetics to SARS-CoV in Vero cell, the novel coronavirus is much more sensitive to 8 type I interferon pretreatment. We subsequently examined homology between SARS-CoV and 9
SARS-CoV-2 in viral proteins shown to be interferon antagonist. The absence of open reading 10 frame (ORF) 3b and significant changes to ORF6 suggest the two key IFN antagonists may not 11 maintain equivalent function in SARS-CoV-2. Together, the results identify key differences in 12 susceptibility to the IFN response between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that could help inform 13 disease progression, treatment options, and animal model development.

At the end of 2019, a cluster of patients in Hubei Province, China was diagnosed with a 17 viral pneumonia of unknown origins. With community links to the Hunnan seafood market in 18
Wuhan, the disease cluster had echoes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 19
(SARS-CoV) outbreak that emerged at the beginning of the century 1 . The 2019 etiologic agent 20 was identified as a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, and subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2 2 . 21
The new virus has nearly 80% nucleotide identity to the original SARS-CoV and the 22 corresponding CoV disease, COVID-19, has many of the hallmarks of SARS-CoV disease 23 including fever, breathing difficulty, bilateral lung infiltration, and death in the most extreme 24 cases 3,4 . In addition, the most severe SARS-CoV-2 disease corresponded to old age (>50 25 years old), health status, and health care workers, similar to both SARS and MERS-CoV 5 . 26
Together, the results indicate SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease have strong similarity to the 27 original SARS-CoV epidemic occurring nearly two decades earlier. 28
In the wake of the outbreak, major research efforts have sought to rapidly characterize 29 the novel CoV to aid in treatment and control. Initial modeling studies predicted 6 and 30 subsequent cell culture studies confirmed that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 utilizes human 31 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry, the same receptor as SARS-CoV 7,8 . 32
Extensive case studies indicated a similar range of disease onset and severe symptoms seen 33 with SARS-CoV 5 . Notably, less severe SARS-CoV-2 cases have also been observed and were 34 not captured in the original SARS-CoV outbreak. Importantly, screening and treatment guidance 35 has relied on previous CoV data generated with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Treatments with 36 both protease inhibitors and type I interferon have been employed 4 ; similarly, remdesivir, a drug 37 targeting viral polymerases, has been reported to have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 similar to 38 findings with both SARS-and MERS-CoV 9-12 . Importantly, several vaccine efforts have been 39 initiated with a focus on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as the major antigenic determinate 13 . 40
Together, the similarities with SARS-CoV have been useful in responding to the newest CoV 41
In this study, we further characterize SARS-CoV-2 and compare it to the original SARS-43
CoV. Using Vero E6 cells, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 maintains similar viral replication 44 kinetics as SARS-CoV following a low dose infection. In contrast, we find that SARS-CoV-2 is 45 much more sensitive to type I interferon (IFN) pretreatment as compared to SARS-CoV. These 46 results suggest distinct changes between the CoVs in terms of IFN antagonism and we 47 subsequently examined sequence homology between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral 48 proteins that may be responsible for these differences. Together, the results suggest SARS-49
CoV-2 lacks the same capacity to control the type I IFN response as SARS-CoV. 50
Our initial studies infected Vero E6 cells using a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to 52 explore the viral replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 relative to SARS-CoV. Following infection, 53
we find that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar kinetics, peaking 48 hours 54 post infection (Fig. 1A) . While SARS-CoV-2 titer had slightly lower viral titers at 24 hours post 55 infection, the results were different statistically different between the novel CoV and the original 56 epidemic strain. By 48 hours, replication in both viruses had plateaued and significant 57 cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections. 58
Together, the results indicated that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 replicate with similar 59 replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells. 60
We next evaluated the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to type I interferon (IFN) 61 pretreatment. Type I IFN treatment has been a standard approach for a wide variety of 62 pathogens including hepatitis B and C viruses as well as HIV 14 . During both the SARS and 63 MERS-CoV outbreaks, type I IFN has been employed with limited effect 15, 16 . In this study, we 64 pretreated Vero E6 cells with 1000 units of recombinant type I IFN 18 hours prior to infection.
Vero E6 lack the capacity to produce type I IFN, but are able to respond to exogenous forms 17 . 66
Following pretreatment with type I IFN, SARS-CoV infection has a modest reduction in viral titer 67
(1.5 log plaque forming units (PFU)) as compared to untreated control 24 hours post infection 68 (Fig. 1B) . However, by 48 hours, SARS-CoV has nearly equivalent viral yields as the untreated 69 conditions (7.2 log PFU versus 7.5 log PFU). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 shows a significant 
Considering the sensitivity to type I IFN, we next sought to evaluate changes between SARS-76
CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. Previous work has established several key IFN antagonist 77 in the SARS-CoV genome including NSP1, NSP3, ORF3b, ORF6, and others 18 . Therefore, we 78 compared the sequence homology across viral proteins from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and 79 several bat SARS-like viruses including WIV16-CoV 19 , SHC014-CoV 20 , and HKU3.1-CoV 21 . 80
Using sequence analysis, we found several changes to SARS-CoV-2 that potentially contribute 81 to its type I IFN sensitivity (Fig. 2) . For SARS-CoV structural proteins including the nucleocapsid 82 (N) and matrix (M) protein, a high degree of sequence homology (>90%AA identity) suggests 83 that their reported IFN antagonism is likely maintained in SARS-CoV-2 and other SARS-like 84 viruses. Similarly, the ORF1ab poly-protein retains high sequence identity in SARS-CoV-2 and 85 several known antagonists contained within the poly-protein (NSP1, NSP7, NSP14-16) are 86 highly conserved relative to SARS-CoV. One notable exception is the large papain-like 87 proteases, NSP3, which only 76% conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. However, 88 other three group 2B bat CoVs had >90% conservation. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 has a two 100 amino acid truncation in its ORF6; previous work has found that alanine substitution in this C-101
terminal of SARS-CoV ORF6 resulted in ablated antagonism 24 . Together, the sequence 102 homology analysis suggests that differences in NSP3, ORF3b, and/or ORF6 may be key drivers 103 of SARS-CoV-2 type I IFN susceptibility. 104
With the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, viral characterization remains 106
a key factor in responding to the emergent novel virus. In this report, we describe differences in 107 the type I IFN sensitivity between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV. While both viruses 108 maintain similar replication in untreated Vero E6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 has a significant decrease 109 in viral replication following type I IFN pretreatment. This sensitivity to type I IFN is distinct from 110 the original SARS-CoV and suggests that the novel CoV has distinct host interactions driving 111 disease outcomes. Analysis of viral proteins finds SARS-CoV-2 has several changes that 112 potentially impact its capacity to modulate the type I IFN response, including loss of ORF3b and 113 a short truncation of ORF6, both known as type I IFN antagonists for SARS-CoV 23 . Together, 114 our results suggest SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have differences in their ability to control the 115 . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license author/funder.

With a similar genome organization and disease symptoms in humans, the SARS-CoV-2 118 outbreak has drawn insights from the closely related SARS-CoV. However, the differences in 119 sensitivity to type I IFN pretreatment illustrates a clear distinction between the two CoVs.

determined. In addition, use of type III IFN, which is predicted to have utility in the respiratory 167 tract, could offer another means for effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2. 168
In addition to treatment, the sensitivity to type I IFN may also have implications for Overall, our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher sensitivity to type I IFN 181 than the previously emergent SARS-CoV. This augmented type I IFN sensitivity is likely due to 182 changes in viral proteins between the two epidemic CoV strains. Moving forward, these data 183 could provide important insights for both the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 as well as developing 184 novel animal models of disease. In this ongoing outbreak, the results also highlight a distinction 185 between the highly related viruses and suggest insights from SARS-CoV must be verified for Thus, significant differences in viral titer were determined by the unpaired two-tailed students T-216 SARS-CoV WT (black) or SARS-CoV-2 (blue) at an MOI of 1 as described above. Each point 357 on the line graph represents the group mean, N=6 for 24 and 48HPI, N=3 for 3HPI. All error 358 bars represent SD. The two tailed students t-test was used to determine P-values: *** P < 359 0.001. 360
