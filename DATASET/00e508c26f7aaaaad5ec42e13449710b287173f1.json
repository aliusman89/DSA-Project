            "text": "Many hand surgery teams have already published their experiences, but all of them focused only on the first lockdown period. Despite this, many found results similar to the authors'. Poggetti et al. [16] analyzed only patients who underwent surgery; they had a diminution in the absolute number of patients treated (168 in 2019 versus 120 in 2020) with patients being on average older, a diminution of traffic-and work-related accidents, and an increase in work and domestic injuries. The only statistical difference in the type of lesion was an increase in patients with a fracture of the proximal and middle phalanges. Atia et al. [17] , discussing all cases reaching their ED, presented a diminution in patients (793 in 2019 versus 463 in 2020) who were also on average older, an increase in intervention rate (41% in 2020 versus 30% in 2019), a diminution in the mean time to surgery, and no difference in the type of cases. Pichard et al. [18] had 275 patients reaching their hand center in the lockdown period of 2020 (versus 784 on the same days of the year before) and patients were older in comparison to 2019 s patients. There was a decrease in work, leisure, and traffic incidents with an increase of domestic lesions. They also described an increase in soft tissue lesions with a decrease in fractures and a higher surgical rate (51.2% versus 36.9%). Fortaine [19] and Pidgeon [20] both described a diminution of 52% of patients reaching their ED, with Fortaine's group also giving details of how sport and work incidents diminished, whereas domestic injuries increased, and how there was a global increase in severity of lesions. Regas et al. [21] also mentioned how hand and wrist lesions were less frequent but more severe. Finally, Ho et al. [13] are the only group with an increase in the number of cases reaching their ED (332 versus 310), this is likely due to the fact that patients from another hospital were automatically transferred to theirs during the lockdown period. Overall, except for this last case, every group had a diminution in the number of patients, although none had a 75% decrease similar to that the authors of this article had when referring to the two months of lockdown. As in most of the papers, the authors had older patients, with a decrease in school and sports injuries and an increase in domestic lesions, whereas traffic and work injuries did not change. Most probably, those results can be explained by the fact that the authors analyzed numbers for the full year following the initial lockdown when homeschooling and sports limitations were underway, but people were allowed to go back to work and use their cars. Also, as in the two papers mentioning the severity of ED injuries [19, 21] , after the outbreak of COVID, injuries were more severe in the authors' EDs. Moreover, in the same period, the authors had an increase in intervention rates such as reported by Atia [17] and Pichard [18] .",

Other changes were brought, including the use of absorbable skin sutures and less frequent check-ups with patients when possible. Additionally, Atia et al. [17] described checking up on patients less frequently, whereas most of authors used telemedicine to follow up with their patients [12, 14, [22] [23] [24] . This is a method that proved its accuracy [25] and found satisfaction among patients [10, 22, 26] , whereas surgeons had frequent issues [10, 22] . The authors did not use telemedicine, and Toia et al. [11] as well as Leti Acciaro et al. [27] confirmed it might be an issue in Italy. To reduce contamination risks [28] , some surgeons increased non-surgical treatment [9, 23] , and to resolve issues linked to a diminution of anesthetists' availability, many hand surgeons [9, 12, 14, 17, 24, 29] stated to use WALANT surgery [30] .",

As in many other hospitals [10, 11, 14, 19] , the authors had all their elective surgery canceled during the first months after the beginning of the lockdown, and still highly diminished during the year that followed, creating a significant lack in young hand surgeons' formative experience. In some cases [9] , residents were allowed limited access to the hospital. Lastly, at the authors' university, as at others [9, 14] , lessons switched from in situ to webinars, leading to a decreased possibility of interaction between professors and residents.",

Nevertheless, the authors believe that this study gives good input and ideas for the future; although the COVID-19 outbreak led to a change in etiologies and frequency of hand trauma, the number of patients reaching ED has remained high, confirming the importance of maintaining a fully functioning hand department during an eventual future pandemic. Authors also believe that the government should increase the prevention of domestic injuries to avoid further increases of lesions in this area if people will be newly obliged to stay home. Finally, as also mentioned by Toia et al. [11] , the Italian government should invest in telemedicine to allow Italian surgeons to treat their patients equally as in other countries if further pandemics occur. Institutional Review Board Statement: Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this retrospective observational study as all data was processed and presented as aggregated data, making not possible to identify any individual patient, in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments.",
