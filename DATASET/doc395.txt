It is of special significance to find a safe and effective vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-11
19) that can induce T cell and B cell -mediated immune responses. There is currently no vaccine to prevent 12 COVID-19. In this project, a novel multi-epitope vaccine for COVID-19 virus based on surface 13
glycoprotein was designed through application of bioinformatics methods. At the first, seventeen potent 14 linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from surface glycoprotein were predicted in silico, then the 15 epitopes were joined together via different linkers. The immunogenicity of these epitopes was identified 16
using IFN-γ ELIspot assays. The IFN-γ producing T cell variation ranged from 11.1 ±1.2 SFU to 38.2 ± 2.1 17 SFU per 10 6 PBMCs. One final vaccine was constructed which composed of 398 amino acids and attached 18
to 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. Physicochemical properties, as well as antigenicity in the 19
proposed vaccines, were checked for defining the vaccine stability and its ability to induce cell-mediated 20 immune responses. Three-dimensional structure of the mentioned vaccine was subjected to the molecular 21
docking studies with MHC-I and MHC-II molecules. The results proposed that the multi-epitope vaccine 22
with 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 was very stable with high aliphatic content and high antigenicity. 23 24 Keyboards: Vaccine, Multi-epitope, Coronavirus, Surface glycoprotein 25 optimize the extensive immunological data such as antigen presentation and processing to achieve 40 specific interpretations [4]. In recent decades, several vaccines were established based on in silico .

In early 2020, COVID-19 began generating headlines all over the world because of the extraordinary speed 28 of its transmission. So, there are rising concerns about community infections. Vaccination is one of the 29 most effective tools to prevent infectious diseases [1] [2]. As far as our knowledge concerns, there is no 30 report about developing COVID-19 multi epitope vaccine. Therefore, we became eager to design potent 31 multiepitope vaccines from antigenic sites of coronavirus surface glycoprotein. The multiepitope 32 vaccines have advantageous over conventional vaccines with regards to safety profile and high 33 immunogenicity [3] . Multiepitope vaccines have the potential to induce responses restricted by a 34 wide variety of HLA molecules and generate a balanced CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immune 35 response. Another molecule that contribute to innate immunity contains TLR3 that activates Escherichia coli [7] , Vibrio cholera [8], Human immunodeficiency virus-1 [9], Hepatitis C virus 43 [10] and many others. In several experimental studies, the efficacy of computationally designed 44 vaccines has been recently approved for use in defined human vaccines [11] [13] . In this study, in 45 silico analysis were performed to determine exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus 46 surface glycoprotein that are antigenically most significant for coronavirus. In our research, some 47 unique exclusive B cell and T-cell epitopes from coronavirus surface glycoprotein were selected 48 based on their antigenicity, stability and length. The selected epitopes were merged into each other 49 using suitable linkers for organization of final vaccine construct. Consequently, the stability and 50 efficacy of the vaccines were predicted by a set of bioinformatics methods. the conserved sequence and antigenic peptide were selected for further analysis.

Seventeen suitable common B-cell and T-cell epitopes (9-16 amino acids) from coronavirus surface 79 glycoprotein were selected and organized in the final vaccine construct. Then, these epitopes were merged 80 together with AAY, KK linkers and considered as a multi-epitope vaccine. One adjuvant "50S ribosomal 81 protein L7/L12 82 (MSDINKLAETLVNLKIVEVNDLAKILKEKYGLDPSANLAIPSLPKAEILDKSKEKTSFDLILKGAG 83 SAKLTVVKRIKDLIGLGLKESKDLVDNVPKHLKKGLSKEEAESLKKQLEEVGAEVELK)
with 124 amino acids were incorporated with EAAAK linker at N-terminal portion of the constructs. 85
The sequence of the designed vaccine structures with their adjuvant are depicted in Table 3 VaxiJen score of the protein showed high antigenicity. Due to having good antigenicity, high exposure 132
probability to the immune system and high conservancy, this protein was selected for vaccine design.
In the current study, some appropriate common B-cell and T-cell epitopes were designed. The predicted 135
MHC-I and MHC-II restricted epitopes were compared to B-cell epitopes to determine shared epitopes 136 (Table 2) . Finally, 17 epitopes with 9-16 amino acids were selected. These epitopes are located between 137 residues 14-642. These epitopes exhibited a relatively high aliphatic index (>60), high antigenicity (>1.6) 138
and low instability index (less than 20). The most potent epitope was repeated three times and merged 139
into the other epitopes using suitable linkers (KK, AYY) for organization of final vaccine construct.
Final construct vaccine was composed of 398 amino acids which were respectively attached to 50S 142 ribosomal protein L7/L12 as adjuvant. The antigenicity score of constructed vaccine are shown in 143 Table 3 . The result demonstrated that IV1 has 1.2110 antigenicity (Table 3) .
Physicochemical properties of the constructed vaccine was predicted using Protparam server. The results 146
revealed that this multi-epitope vaccine have low instability "as a value below 40" predicts that the 147 protein is stable. The IV1 construct showed the highest Isoelectric point with 8.52 value. From the 148 aliphatic Index of view, this construct showed aliphatic index more than 90 % ( We examined the numbers of primed CD4+ cells that produced IFN-γ in response to epitopes, using 160
ELISPOT assays described in results proposed that our multi-epitope vaccine was very stable with high aliphatic index and it was 184 potentially antigenic. As reported earlier, high aliphatic index shows the higher thermos-stability of the 185 constructed vaccine. At the present research, the aliphatic index was high, and instability was low and 186
Gravy indices were negative. Also, the higher PI, as the case of this study, shows the higher potential for 187 cell wall attachment. However, the proposed vaccine has high antigenicity.
