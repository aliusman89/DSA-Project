The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been growing since its first identification in December 2019. The publishing of the first SARS-CoV-2 genome made a valuable source of data to study the details about its phylogeny, evolution, and interaction with the host. Proteinprotein binding assays have confirmed that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is more likely to be the cell receptor via which the virus invades the host cell. In the present work, we provide an insight into the interaction of the viral spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) from different coronavirus isolates with host ACE2 protein. We used homology-based protein-protein : bioRxiv preprint 2 docking, binding energy estimation, and decomposition, aiming to predict both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the interaction. Using in silico structural modelling, we brought additional evidence that the interface segment of the spike protein RBD might be acquired by SARS-CoV-2 via a complex evolutionary process rather than mutation accumulation. We also highlighted the relevance of Q493 and P499 amino acid residues of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for binding to hACE2 and maintaining the stability of the interface. Finally, we studied the impact of eight different variants located at the interaction surface of ACE2, on the complex formation with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found that none of them is likely to disrupt the interaction with the viral RBD of SARS-CoV-2.

The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as nCoV -19) has been 4 associated with the recent epidemic of acute respiratory distress syndrome 5 [9] , [2] . Recent studies have suggested that the virus binds to the ACE2 6 receptor on the surface of the host cell using the spike protein and explored 7 the binary interaction of these two partners [4, 12, 28] . In this work, we 8 focused our analysis on the interface residues to get insight into four main 9 subjects: (1) The architecture of the interface of the spike protein and 10 whether its evolution in many isolates supports an increase in affinity 11 toward the ACE2 receptor; (2) How the affinity of SARS-COV-2-RBD and 12 SARS-CoV-RBD toward different ACE2 homologous proteins from different 13 species is dictated by a divergent interface sequences (3); A comparison of 14 the interaction hotspots between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2; and finally, 15 (4) whether any of the studied ACE2 variants may show a different binding 16 property compared to the reference allele. To tackle these questions we 17 used multiscale modelling approaches combined to sequence and phylogeny 18 analysis.
Sequences and data retrieval 21 Full genome sequences of 10 Coronaviruses isolates were retrieved from NCBI 22 GeneBank corresponding to the following accessions: AY485277. 1 
The sequences of the surface glycoprotein were extracted from the Coding 32 Segment (CDS) translation feature from each genome annotation or by 33 locally aligning the protein from SARS-CoV-2 with all possible ORFs from 34 the translated genomes. ACE2 orthologous sequences from Human (Uniprot 35 sequence Q9BYF1), Masked palm civet (NCBI protein AAX63775. 1 Human variants of the ACE2 gene were collected from the gnomAD 44 database [7] . Only variants that map to the protein coding region and 45 belonging to the interface of interaction with the RBD of the spike protein 46 were retained for further analyses.
Sequence analysis and phylogeny tree calculation 48 MAFFT was used to align the whole genome sequences and the protein 49 sequences of viral RBDs [8] . For the genome comparison, we selected the 50 best site model based on lowest Bayesian Information Criterion calculated 51 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

The 52 General Time Reversible (GTR) model was chosen as the best fitting model 53 for nucleotide substitution with discrete Gamma distribution (+G) with 5 54 rate categories. For the RBD sequences, the best substitution model for 55 ML calculation was selected using a model selection tool implemented on 56 MEGA 6 software based on the lowest Bayesian Information criterion (BIC) 57 score. Therefore, the WAG model [24] using a discrete Gamma distribution 58 (+G) with 5 rate categories has been selected.
Phylogenetic trees were generated using a maximum likelihood (ML) 60 method in MEGA 6. The consistency of the topology, for the RBD sequences, 61 was assessed using a bootstrap method with 1000 replicates. The resulting 62 phylogenetic tree was edited with iTOL [13] . The co-crystal structure of the spike protein of SARS coronavirus com-66 plexed to human human-civet chimeric receptor ACE2 was solved at 3Åof 67 resolution (PDB code 3SCL). We used this structure as a template to build 68 the complex of spike protein from different virus isolates with the human 69 ACE2 protein (Uniprot sequence Q9BYF1). The template sequences of the 70 ligand (spike protein) and the receptor (ACE2) were aligned locally with the 71 target sequences using the program Water from the EMBOSS package [16] . 72 Modeller version 9.22 [18] was then used to predict the complex model of 73 each spike protein with the ACE2 using a slow refining protocol. For each 74 model, we generated ten conformers from which we selected the model with 75 the best DOPE score [19] .
To calculate the binding energy we used the PRODIGY server [27] . 77 The Calculation of contribution of each amino acid in a protein partner 78 was computed with MM-GBSA method implemented in the HawkDock 79 server [23] . Different 3D structures of hACE2, each comprising one of 80 identified variants, were modeled using the BuildModel module of FoldX5 [3] . 81 Because it is more adapted to predict the effect of punctual variations of 82 amino acids, we used DynaMut at this stage of analysis [17] .

The protein backbone was kept fully flexible and the number 89 of the Monte carlo cycles was set to 100.
Sequence and phylogeny analysis 92 Phylogenetic analysis of the different RBD sequences revealed two well 93 supported clades. Clade 2 includes SARS-CoV-2, RatG13, SZ16, ZS-C, 94 WIV16, MA15, and SARS-CoV-Sino1-11 isolates ( Figure 1A ). SARS-CoV-2 95 and RatG13 sequences are the closest to the common ancestor of this clade. 96 Clade 1 includes Rm1 isolate, Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21. 97 These three isolates are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 as revealed by the 98 phylogenetic tree constructed from the entire genome ( Figure 1A ). The 99 exact tree topology is reproduced when we used only the RBD segment 100 corresponding to the interface residues with hACE2. This is a linear 101 sequence spanning from residue N481 to N501 in SARS-CoV-2.
Multiple sequence alignment showed that the interface segment of SARS-103 CoV-2 shares higher similarity to sequences from clade 2 ( Figure 1B ). 104 However, we noticed that S494, Q498 and P499 are exclusively similar 105 to their equivalent amino acids in sequences from clade 1. SARS-CoV-2 106 interface sequence is closely related to Bat-CovRaTG13 sequence, isolated 107 from a Rhinolophus affinis bat.
Prediction of the RBD/hACE2 complex structure 109 To investigate whether the interface of the spike protein isolates evolves 110 by increasing the affinity toward the ACE2 receptor in the final host, we 111 predicted the interaction models of the envelope anchored spike protein (SP) 112 from several clinically relevant Coronavirus isolates with the human receptor 113 .

The construction of the complex applies a comparative-114 based approach that uses a template structure in which both partners 115 (ligand and receptor) are closely related to those in the target system 116 respectively. In our study, we only modeled the interaction of the RBD 117 which was shown to be implicated in the physical interaction with ACE2 118 receptor ( Figure 2A ). The lowest sequence identity of the modeled spike 119 proteins as well as those of any of the orthologous ACE2 sequences (Human, 120 civet, bat, pig, rat, chicken and snake) do not fall below 63% compared to 121 their respective templates. At such values of sequence identities between 122 the equivalent partners of the receptor or the ligand, it is expected that the 123 template and the target complexes share the same binding mode [1, 10] .

CoV with different animal ACE2 receptors 136 We made this analysis to investigate the tendency of SARS-CoV-2 and 137 SARS-CoV to interact with different orthologous forms of ACE2 which is 138 dictated by the divergence in their interacting surfaces. Homology based 139 protein-protein docking was conducted to generate the interaction model 140 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2 receptor from different animal species 141 ( Figure 2C ). We noticed that for the civet, dog, chicken and snake forms, 142 the interaction energy is very low and very similar either for SARS-CoV-2 143 or SARS-CoV. Although the Kd are relatively low for the rat and bat forms 144 interacting with SARS-CoV RBD, those of SARS-CoV-2 are high and go 145 beyond 50 nM. On the other hand, it seems that the interaction with pig 146 ACE2 is more favorable for SARS-CoV-2 isolate since the estimated Kd is 147 3 folds lesser compared to SARS-CoV-2.
The MM-GBSA calculation allowed us to assign the contribution in the 150 binding energy of each amino acid in the interface with hACE2. We 151 carried this analysis using both sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 152 ( Figure 3A ) and the Sino1-11 SARS-CoV ( Figure 3B) isolates. Residues 153 F486, Y489, Q493, G496, T500 and N501 of SARS-CoV-2 RBD form the 154 hotspots of the interface with hACE2 protein were investigated (we only 155 consider values > 1 or < 1 kcal/mol to ignore the effect due to the thermal 156 fluctuation). All these amino acids form three patches of interaction spread 157 along the linear interface segment ( Figure 3C ): two from the N and C 158 termini and one central. T500 establishes two hydrogen bonds using its 159 side and main chains with Y41 and N330 of hACE2. N501 forms another 160 hydrogen bond with ACE2 residue K353 buried within the interface. On the 161 other hand, SARS-CoV RBD interface contains five residues ( Figure 3D ), 162 L473, Y476, Y485, T487 and T488 corresponding to the equivalent hotspot 163 residues of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 F487, Y490, G497, T501 and N502. 164 Therefore, Q493 as a hotspot amino acid is specific to SARS-CoV-2 interface. 165 The equivalent residue N480 in SARS-CoV only shows a non-significant 166 contribution of 0.18 kcal/mol.

In order to further investigate 171 its role, we performed a flexibility analysis using a reference structure 172 (SARS-CoV-2 RBD containing P499) and an in silico mutated form P499T, 173 a residue found in SARS-CoV and most of the clade 2. Our results show 174 that the mutation caused a significant decrease in stability for nine residues 175 of the interface corresponding to segment 482-491 ( Figure 3E) . Indeed, the 176 RMSF variability per amino acid for this sequence increases compared to 177 the reference structure.

A total of eight variants of hACE2 that map to the interaction surface 180 are described in the gnomAD database. All these variants are rare (Ta-181 ble 1) and mostly found in European non-Finnish and African populations. 182 Considering both the enthalpy (ddG) and the vibrational entropy in our 183 calculation (ddS), we found no significant change in the interaction energy 184 (> 1 or < 1 kcal/mol) (Figure 4 ). 185 Figure 4 . Estimation of the energy changing upon mutation for hACE2 variants. Both Enthalpy and entropy terms are computed.
Since the Covid-2019 outbreak, several milestone papers have been published 187 to examine the particularity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its putative 188 interaction with ACE2 as a receptor [25, 26] . In the current study, we 189 focused our analysis on the interface segments of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD 190 interacting with ACE2 from different species by estimating interaction 191 energy profiles. 192 We have studied the effect of eight variants of ACE2 in order to detect 193 polymorphisms that may increase or decrease the virulence in the host. We 194 concluded that if ACE2 is the only route for the infection in humans, variants 195 interacting physically with RBD are not likely to disrupt the formation of 196 the complex and would have a marginal effect on the affinity. Therefore, it 197 . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license author/funder. It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.04.976027 doi: bioRxiv preprint is unlikely that any form of resistance to the virus, related to the ACE2 198 gene, exists. However, this analysis merits to be investigated in depth in 199 different ethnic groups for a better assessment of the contribution of genetic 200 variability in host-pathogen interaction. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD 201 to different forms of ACE2 shows similar values compared to SARS-CoV 202 which is in agreement with the ability of the virus to cross the species barrier. 203 However, although we estimated low Kd value between SARS-CoV RBD 204 and Gallus gallus ACE2, there have been no reported cases of SARS-CoV 205 isolated from chicken. On the other hand, while Kd is high for SARS-CoV 206 RBD interacting with porcine ACE2, there are only few reported cases 207 of such type [20] . Indeed, host-pathogen interaction is a complex process 208 unlikely to be controlled only by the binding of the spike protein with 209 ACE2 [5] . For model animals where Kd values are very low, ACE2 analysis 210 may play a key role in targeting the main animal reservoir of SARS-CoV-2. 211 For high Kd values, other factors might regulate the infection including the 212 implication of different receptors or the response of the immune system but 213 that does not mean that the infection is unlikely to occur. On the other 214 hand, whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the different isolates included 215 in this study is consistent with previous works that place the Wuhan-Hu-1 216 isolate close to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 isolates [14, 15, 22] 217 within the Betacoronavirus genus. The use of RBD sequences, however, 218 places the virus in a clade that comprises SARS-CoV related homologs 219 including isolates from Bat and Civet. The clade swapping as seen in 220 figure 1A , seems also to occur for RaTG13 and Rm1 isolated from bat. This 221 is expected as the use of different phylogenetic markers may considerably 222 affect the topology of the tree. However, given the functional implication 223 of the spike RBD in host-pathogen infection, we have raised the question 224 about where the virus obtained its RBD binding interface. The binding of 225 the spike glycoprotein to ACE2 receptor requires a certain level of affinity. 226 In the case where the RBD evolves from an ancestral form closer to that of 227 Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21, we expected a decrease of the 228 binding energy through the evolution process following incremental changes 229 in the RBD. In such a scenario, we presume that there are other intermediary 230 forms of coronavirus that describe such variation of the binding energy to 231 reach a level where the pathogen can cross the species barriers and infect 232 .

On the other hand, our results 233 show that the binding energy and the interface sequence of SARS-CoV-2 234 RBD are closer to SARS-CoV related isolates (either from Human or other 235 species). Therefore a recombination event involving the spike protein that 236 might have occurred between SARS-CoV and an ancestral form of the 237 current SARS-CoV-2 virus might be also possible. This will allow for the 238 virus to acquire a minimum set of residues for the interaction with hACE2. 239 The recombination in the spike protein gene has been previously suggested 240 by Wei et al in their phylogenetic analysis [6] . Thereafter, incremental 241 changes in the binding interface segment will occur in order to reach a 242 better affinity toward the receptor. One of these changes may involve P499 243 residue which substitution to threonine seems to drastically destabilize the 244 interface segment and has a distant effect. Moreover, the decomposition 245 of the interaction energy showed that 5 out of 6 hotspot amino acids in 246 SARS-CoV-2 have their equivalent in SARS-CoV including N501. Contrary 247 to what Wan et al [22] have stated, the single mutation N501T does not 248 seem to enhance the affinity. Rather, the residue Q493 might be responsible 249 for such higher affinity due to a better satisfaction of the Van der Waals 250 by the longer polar side chain of asparagine. Indeed, when we made the 251 same analysis while mutating Q493 to N493, the favorable contribution 252 decreases from -2.55 kcal/mol to a non significant value of -0.01 kcal/mol, 253 thus supporting our claim.
