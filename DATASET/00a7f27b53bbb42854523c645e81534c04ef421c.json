Patients were recruited from hospitals and a dialysis center in Kunshan, China. Patients converting from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis to automated peritoneal dialysis were recruited as the observation group (n = 64), and patients continuing with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis treatment were included in the control group (n = 64) after matching in this retrospective cohort study. Their health-related quality of life was measured using the kidney disease quality of life instrument in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Baseline socio-demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected in 2019. The before-and-after cross-group comparisons of subscale scores of two groups were conducted using a Student's t-test. Multiple linear regression models were fitted to identify the factors associated with the change of each scale.",

The health-related quality of life scores of the two groups was comparable in baseline, while the observation group had higher scores in Physical Component Summary (51.92 \u00b1 7.50), Kidney Disease Component Summary (81.21 \u00b1 8.41), Symptoms (90.76 \u00b1 6.30), Effects (82.86 \u00b1 11.42), and Burden (69.04 \u00b1 15.69) subscales after one year.

CAPD is performed manually, whereas APD is performed with the assistance of mechanical device and has been associated with better patient compliance (Bernardini, Nagy & Piraino, 2000) . Since many systematic reviews found that the safety and clinical outcomes of CAPD and APD are largely comparable (Rabindranath et al., 2007; Athanasios et al., 2020; Tang, Chen & Fang, 2016) , evidence on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is important when nephrologists and patients choose PD modality in practice (Wright & Wilson, 2015) . To the best of our knowledge, studies conducted in other countries showed that the HRQOL was largely equivalent between patients treated with CAPD and APD (Guney et al., 2010; Michels et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2018; Mpharm et al., 2020) . Since these studies were mainly cross-sectional designs that could not analyze the impact of converting PD modalities on ESRD patients, current knowledge of this topic remains little. Besides, some Chinese studies have targeted the HRQOL of HD and PD patients (Zhang et al., 2007; Bieber et al., 2014) , but they did not conclude on the HRQOL of CAPD and APD patients. Therefore, this study fills the gaps of knowledge and would provide real-world evidence for the selection of dialysis modalities in clinical settings.",

Fortunately, health insurance authorities and healthcare facilities in Kunshan, Jiangsu, China have tried to promote the use of APD since 2019. Kunshan is a highly developed city in China with a GDP per capita that is equivalent to a city in a developed country.

This difference in results may be due to the fact that Wit et al. used SF-36 and EQ-5D instead of KDQOL-36. In addition to the fact that APD operated at night can liberate patients during the day, other reasons for higher HRQOL in APD patients in this study include remote monitoring and management of dialysis indicators conducted by specialized doctors and timely guidance from the family doctor during follow-up, which means that the technological advantages and professional supports of APD could improve the physiological and diseasespecific component. This study did not find differences in MCS subscale scores, which was inconsistent with earlier cross-sectional studies that suggested that APD patients performed better in psychological states (Mpharm et al., 2020; Cort\u00e9s-Sanabria et al., 2013; Wit et al., 2001; Diaz-Buxo et al., 2000) .

Second, higher education level was associated with the decrease of MCS and Burden, which means that patients who were more educated and actively learned more about the disease might be worried about the negative outcomes. Though Yang et al. did not observe the impact of education level on the HRQOL of APD and CAPD patients (Yang et al., 2018) , it may be caused by the well-established education system and social welfare policy in Singapore, and the fact that HRQOL is a subjective evaluation deeply influenced by social culture. Third, CCI(>2) was associated with the changes of MCS and Symptoms respectively. Previous studies explored the impact of CCI but no statistical correlation was found (Bilgic et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2018) . Diseases are not mutually exclusive.

For clinical practice, in addition to the objective physiological indicators, the subjective feelings of patients should also be considered during dialysis treatment. Patientoriented medical services are worth recommending, which include involving family members and caregivers in dialysis treatment for ESRD patients, especially the older patients, and strengthening psychological support for well-educated patients. As for health administration, APD is mainly used at clinical rescue and ICU and lacks large-scale application in China.

China is a vast country with areas of different socioeconomic development, therefore the results of this study cannot be extrapolated to less developed areas in China. Second, although we started data collection when the APD project was launched in Kunshan, the one-year follow-up might not be long enough to observe the significant changes in MCS subscale scores. Besides, even though the sample size in this study was sufficient enough to detect the effects, HRQOL is a subjective evaluation which closely related to the social and cultural background, thus, the conclusion needs further validation in other regions. Third, factors influencing the conversion of dialysis modality might also contribute to confounding bias, such as cognition and acceptance of new technology, economic level, clinical indications, etc.",

With the increasing use of APD in China, further studies should focus on the HRQOL of APD patients in other regions to expand the sample size and improve representativeness.",
