At the same time, countries are following protective safety measures, such as hygiene practices and social distancing, suggested by health experts. Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated countries of the world with a population of 165.2 million, has been highly susceptible to COVID-19 since no proven vaccine or medicine is available for the disease right now (2, 3) . There have been 417,475 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6,036 confirmed deaths owing to the disease in this country so far, and the number is still counting (4) . The pandemic can have a serious impact on the country due to its large population size, vulnerable economy, and weak healthcare system. The healthcare system of Bangladesh is still not well-prepared to face this health emergency (5) .",

The theory was first introduced in the 1960's to explain human health change behavior (13) . The model has been classified into three consecutive processes, i.e., knowledge, general attitudes, and adoption (practices) of behaviors called KAP theory. According to this theory, there is a progressive relationship among knowledge, attitudes, and behavior as follows: knowledge is the foundation of behavioral change, while belief and attitudes are the driving force of behavioral change. The basic presumption is that one's health promotion and effective illness management are linked with KAP level. On the other hand, poor health and maladaptive disease preventive behavior are associated with KAP deficiency (14) . This way we assume that the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients with chronic illnesses concerning COVID-19 can effectively increase or decrease their awareness, positive attitudes, and behaviors influencing the disease outcome. We, therefore, took KAP as the analytical model considering its relevance to the assessment of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of patients with chronic illnesses concerning COVID-19 in Bangladesh.",

The research was performed in Khulna city of Bangladesh from May 2020 to September 2020. Given the risks of contacting COVID-19 with face-to-face interviews, we chose telephone interviews to collect data from our participants. Instead of population statistics, our sampling involved the particularly vulnerable group of patients with chronic illnesses during the pandemic as we selected the respondents purposively. The contact details of the participants were collected from the registration records of different clinics and health centers. We called the patients with chronic illnesses who visited medical practitioners in those clinics and health centers previously over the phone and briefed them about our research initially. Those who agreed to participate in our study were contacted further for data collection.",

Ten participants with each of these chronic illnesses were selected for interviews in this study. We used a semi-structured interview guide developed through a rigorous analysis of the previous literature on similar topics. Starting from the age of 18, we included patients from each of the four chronic illness categories where respondents of different ages, sex, religion, residence, marital status, and social classes participated to ensure maximum diversification of information ( Table 1) . While conducting qualitative research, telephone interviews can often be difficult to bring out narrative data. So we employed effective strategies based on lessons learned from previous studies that followed the same technique (16, 17) . We cultivated rapport, maintained regular connection, incorporated concerns, and acknowledged the contribution of our participants to ensure maximum effort and overcome the adversities that might limit the scope of this study during the 4-month of data collection. The duration of each interview varied based on the convenience of the respondents and the data collectors through an average session would last between 30 and 40 min. As it is often difficult to take the interview over the phone for a very long time and to enter into a deep conversation within a very short time, we carefully maneuvered this issue throughout data collection. Potential inquisitive questions and probes were used for further understanding of the reality experienced by the participants. We included a set of questions for our interviews in this study and provided this as Supplementary Material along with this manuscript. Authors, SRR, NAN, and MFR, conducted the interviews and collected data through multiple sessions and with the convenience of the participants.",

Corresponding to this theory, we also observed that the education and knowledge of our participants are interrelated (22) . We found that participants with higher social status and living in urban areas had higher knowledge levels and followed the safety instructions recommended by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh and WHO more accurately than the others. Around two-thirds of the total population in Bangladesh live in rural areas while most of them are poor (2, 24) . While these people had some basic knowledge, they were often unwilling to practice the health instructions properly due to work-related and financial reasons (6) . Besides financial issues, we also recorded that religion was linked with knowledge, attitude, and practices concerning COVID-19. We observed that many orthodox followers of Islam were unwilling to practice social distancing and believed that the COVID-19 pandemic is a curse from God and will not affect the believers (15) . Research is required to understand if this is similar in other predominantly Muslim countries, and indeed, in other orthodox followers of other religions around the world. Targeted public health information is required to work with religious communities to reduce the risks of transmission of COVID-19.",

It is interesting that, more than surrounding people like friends and family or healthcare professionals, mass media played a more important role in spreading awareness on COVID-19 and helped to curb the transmission of the disease (30, 31) . In contrast, the participants with low education have reported learning about the virus mostly from people around them (29, 31) . We found a majority of the participants to hold an optimistic attitude toward COVID-19 patients and expressed positive ideas to overcome the pandemic in line with some of the previous research (20, 22) . We also observed that safe practices were significantly higher among the women, married, educated, and those who live in urban areas (6, 19) while safety practices and use of protective equipment were less common among the unmarried, illiterate, and rural men (19, 22) .",

However, we employed effective interviewing strategies, such as maintenance of regular contacts and recording concerns of the interviewees, over a significant time to overcome the odds. Besides, there may be questions regarding the simplification of results with a few numbers of participants, but we strengthened the rigor of information by the quality of the data in our study. The main strength of this study, however, was its novelty that we employed KAP theory from the qualitative perspective in Bangladesh for the first time in this study.

The findings of this study revealed that the patients with chronic illnesses had moderate knowledge and a positive attitude toward COVID-19, but their safety practices were weak. Although the government has already taken several steps to mitigate the spread of the diseases, it has been difficult to ensure proper safety practices due to different socioeconomic issues. Applying the KAP theory, we tried to how the participants' knowledge, attitude, and practices depend on their level of awareness. Owing to these facts, health education programs and policy interventions are necessary to ensure the health and well-being of patients with chronic illnesses right now. Under this circumstance, the above findings have some important policy implications. First, awareness programs on mass media should be emphasized more under the lockdown situation. Second, specialized and emergency medical services should be ensured for the patients with chronic illnesses. Third, the government needs to impose safety practices more strictly. Special subsidies on hygiene products and personal protective equipment can be provided to make it more available for people. Finally, we suggest that patients with chronic illnesses be prioritized when the vaccines are available. Preferably, it should be provided free of charge to the vulnerable groups who are at high risk at present. While implications of this study will help policymakers and researchers, we recommend further research on this topic to get a comprehensive idea of the knowledge, attitude, and practices concerning COVID-19 in Bangladesh.",
