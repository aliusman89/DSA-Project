
(22.77%) and 18 (17.82%) patients, respectively. Chest computed tomographic scans of non-survivors showed vast and fused ground-glass shadows. Compared to patients who survived 3 days, no statistical difference was noticed on lung severity score (11.91 vs 12.07) in patients who died within 3 days. Furthermore, significant elevated laboratory indicators including hypersensitive troponin (1.98 vs 0.2ng/ml), blood urea nitrogen (15.20 vs 10.08mmol/l), neutrophil count (11.23 vs 6.48×109/L), procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58ng/ml) and lactic acid (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/l) etc. were noted in patients who died with 3 days while PaO2 (54.75 vs 67.45mmHg), CD3% (51.57 vs 60.43%) and CD8% (16.42 vs 23.42%) were significantly depressed.
Older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities had a steeply increased risk of death when they suffered COVID-19. Besides respiratory failure, acute cardiac and kidney damage or failure, secondary to COVID-19, played a crucial role in causing death of patients.
Since December 2019, the outbreak of corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) which swept across China and emerged in many other countries have caused global concerns [1] . As of March 4, 2020, a total of 80420 COVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed and over 2900 lost their life. In the early stages of this COVID-19, respiratory infection symptoms occurred, with some patients rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure and even death.
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the concealed onset, similar or stronger contagion and lower mortality could be defined as the clinical features of the disease [2] [3] [4] .
However, many patients suffered a death attack in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan City, China.
Previous studies concentrated to show the epidemiological findings, clinical characteristics, and clinical outcome of patient with COVID-19 involved in mild and severe cases [5] [6] . But those infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are vulnerable to suffer severe attack or death, the causes that lead to the occurrence of rapid death are necessary to be addressed further.
Information regarding clinical features of death caused by COVID-19 has not been reported yet. We aimed to describe the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological characteristics and outcomes of non-surviving hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to analyze the possible risk factors that lead to death of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In this study, we investigated the characteristics of non-surviving patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (including Shouyi campus and Eastern campus) before February 15, 2020 . We hope that this study will provide some important information regarding to death of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

There were no significant differences of self-report symptoms between two groups including fever, dyspnea, cough, fatigue etc. (Table 1) 
There were quite a lot differences of laboratory parameters between patients who died within 3 days of admission and those survived 3 days. Those died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (12.36 ×10 9 vs 7.72×10 9 /L), neutrophil count (11.23×10 9 vs 6.48×10 9 /L) and lower eosinophils count (0.009 ×10 9 vs 0.028×10 9 /L). Compared with patients who survived 3 days of admission, patients died within 3 days presented with significantly higher percentage of neutrophils (88.86% vs 81.95%) but significantly lower percentages of lymphocytes (7.18% vs 10.94%), monocytes (3.8% vs 6.56%) and eosinophils (0.06% vs 0.34%). For other biochemical indexes, procalcitonin (2.26 vs 0.58 ng/ml), hsTnI (1.98 vs 0.2 ng/ml), Creatine kinase-MB (6.14 vs 2.78 ng/ml), myoglobin (437.7 vs 216.8 ug/L) and blood urea nitrogen (15.2 vs 10.08 mmol/L) were over normal range and significantly higher in patients died within 3 days of admission. (Table 3) Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (80.58% vs 88.37%), higher lactate level (3.80 vs 2.62 mmol/L) and lower pH value (7.40 vs 7.42) compared with those survived 3 days.
Although patients died within 3 days of admission had higher PaCO2 (38.97 vs 35.44 mmHg) and lower PaO2 (54.75 vs 67.45 mmHg), but there were no significant differences between two groups ( Table 4) . Cellular and humoral immunity analysis also revealed several differences between patients died within and over 3 days including percentage of CD3 + cells and CD8 + cells, concentrations of IgE antibody and C3 complement. Although only percentage of CD3 + cells in patients died within 3 days was below normal range, the percentage of CD3 + cells (51.57% vs 60.43%) and CD8 + cells (16.42% vs 23.42%) were significantly lower in patients died within 3 All rights reserved.

Patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher level of IgE antibody over normal range compared with those survived 3 days (157.3 vs 86.44 IU/ml). Level of C3 complement was within normal range in both groups with a significantly higher titration in patients died within 3 days compared with those survived 3 days (1.03 vs 0.89g/L). Other immune parameters did not show significant differences between patients died within 3 days of admission and over 3 days. ( Table 5 )
Chest CT scans were used to evaluate the features of lung injury. Only 38 cases had chest CT image in our medical system (11 cases in within 3 days subgroup and 27 cases in over 3 days subgroup). Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung imaging features presented the vast or merged glass shadow, but quantitation of lung lobe injury and injury score revealed no significant difference between the two subgroups. (Table 4 and Table 6 . Among all treatments, except for noninvasive ventilation, no significant difference was noted between two groups.
This report, to our knowledge, is the largest case series to analyze died patients with COVID-19 in hospital. As of February 15, 2020, 101 patients died because of All rights reserved.

We aim to present the clinical features, organ dysfunction, laboratory indicators of the 101 non-survivors, and analyze possible causes accounted for the rapid progress of disease and death. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, major gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment measures of COVID-19 posed huge challenge for our clinical practice.
Although previous study reported the mortality of patients with COVID-19 is 1.4% [12] , some special population including the aged and individuals with underlying comorbidities may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In our cohort, the median age of non-survivor was 71 years, 81.19% of them combined with one or more underlying medical conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and malignancy. This study suggested that patients aged over 70 years with chronic medical conditions were more likely to suffer a severe attack and death.
Common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue etc. [5, 13] . In our cohort, we observed that, besides fever and cough, dyspnea (58.42%) presented early in most non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19, similar finding has also been observed in critically ill patients reported by Yang etc. [14] . In these non-survivors, featured complications during hospitalization including ARDS and respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury (ACI), AKI, acute liver injury (ALI) and abnormal coagulation. In terms of SARS, severe respiratory failure was the leading cause of mortality, with little other organ failure [15] . It is surprised that we observed 52.48% and 22.77% non-survivors suffered heart failure and AKI, respectively.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial SARS-CoV-2 receptor, distributed widely in heart, kidney and intestine etc. [16] [17] [18] . Whether SARS-CoV-2 attack heart and kidney or other vital organs directly need to be confirmed further.
The most common laboratory abnormalities observed in this study were elevated white blood cell count, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, high sensitivity troponin, blood urea nitrogen and decreased lymphocytes percentage etc. (Table 3,

In addition, the characteristic chest CT imaging of these non-survivors were evaluated by previous described method [19] . The CT features demonstrated extensive infection and severe damage, regarded as "white lung", in five lobes, but no significant difference was found between the two groups. These characteristics combined with above repented organ failure, laboratory abnormalities suggested that early organ dysfunction or failure were responsible for rapid progression of disease and death of the patients.
Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment except supportive care and organ support [5, 20] . In current clinical practice, arbidol was used as an antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, but the curative effect remains unclear. Other antiviral medications including remdesivir and lopinavir etc. are still being verified in clinical trials. Furthermore, use of intravenous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of anti-infection for severely ill patients and steroids are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short duration of treatment as possible [21] . In this study, 96.04% patients received antiviral therapy, 98.02% received antibacterial therapy. Use of glucocorticoid mainly depended on the severity of inflammatory response. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, all the non-survivors received oxygen inhalation therapy including high flow oxygen inhalation (77.23%), but quite a low proportion of patients received machine ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing number of patients.

Secondly, incomplete medical information of some non-survivors may lead to the occurrence of bias. Thirdly, patients died within a short time after admission is unfavorable to track risk factors for this poor outcome. Finally, in the early outbreak of COVID-19, relatively inadequate medical resources may affect the observation of the natural course of disease.
The findings of our study suggested that older patients (>70 years) with comorbidities are at higher risks for poor outcomes. Besides respiratory failure, acute heart injury and kidney injury, secondary to COVID-19, played a crucial role in causing death of
