This work summarizes our preliminary findings on automatic detection of respiratory distress using well-known acoustic and prosodic features. Speech samples are collected from de-identified telemedicine phonecalls from a healthcare provider in Bangladesh. The recordings include conversational speech samples of patients talking to doctors showing mild or severe respiratory distress or asthma symptoms. We hypothesize that respiratory distress may alter speech features such as voice quality, speaking pattern, loudness, and speech-pause duration. To capture these variations, we utilize a set of well-known acoustic and prosodic features with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for detecting the presence of respiratory distress. Experimental evaluations are performed using a 3-fold cross-validation scheme, ensuring patient-independent data splits. We obtained an overall accuracy of 86.4% in detecting respiratory distress from the speech recordings using the acoustic feature set. Correlation analysis reveals that the top-performing features include loudness, voice rate, voice duration, and pause duration.",

Spirometry is the most commonly used test for an initial respiratory assessment of a patient. Confirmatory diagnosis of various respiratory disorders may require additional examination such as a chest x-ray or other laboratory tests. It is well known that shortness of breathing affects the human speech production mechanism [8] and, in theory, respiratory distress should be detectable from the speech signal analysis alone. Thus, automatic initial assessment of respiratory function from speech can be valuable in low-resource settings where there is a lack of experienced general practitioners.",

Although the authors claim that the system can be used for detecting pathological conditions, only healthy volunteer data were used for evaluation. In [13] , the authors introduced \"Spirocall\", a method of performing spirometry using standard telephone calls. This method uses a 3D printed whistle and transmits the breathing effort's sound via the telephone channel.

Since the lung is a vital organ for speech production, and respiratory disease is expected to cause physical changes in the speech production pathway and affect speech signal itself [14] . Previous research [15] shows that the lung volumes and breathing patterns during speech differ from quiet respiration, and alterations in speech breathing are disease and task-specific. Asthmatic patients tend to show an increased duration of silence between speech segments, lower syllable rates, and increased time in non-speech ventilatory activity [16] . Thus, we can assume that respiratory distress will affect the speaking rate and speech breathing pattern [8] . In [17] , a high degree of correlation was found between FEV1/FEV ratio obtained from spirometry and harmonicsto-noise ratio (HNR) obtained from human speech for asthma patients. This motivates us to consider traditional acoustic features to analyze speech signals to detect respiratory distress symptoms.",

A patient's recordings were included if the patient called in to report suffering from respiratory distress.

In the final stage, the feature sets are fused by concatenation, and correlation-based feature reduction is performed to reduce the feature dimension to 251. The results are summarized in Table 4 . From the result, we observe that for acoustic features, the classifier shows a mean accuracy of 86.4 (\u00b12.1)% with the best sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC. The acoustic features have consistent performance across the 3 folds, including identical AUC values indicating the subject/patient invariance of the classifier. Compared to the acoustic features, the prosodic features performed were sub-par. This feature set resulted in an accuracy of only 56.5 (\u00b12.5)%, which slightly better than a random classifier.

We observe that features that can be physiologically connected to respiratory distress are included, such as loudness, voice rate, voice duration, pause duration. Loudness is the most prominent feature in detecting respiratory distress. Spectral and cepstral features are also found to be important in the ranking analysis, confirming our hypothesis that voice quality can be altered due to respiratory distress (e.g., increased hoarseness).

The topranked features obtained by correlation analysis were found to be physiologically meaningful.

A further large-scale clinical study is required to confirm the diagnostic usability of the proposed approach.",
