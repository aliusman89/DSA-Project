            "text": "In recent years, the consumption of alcohol among university students has become a problem of health concern at an international level [1, 2] . As reported in the Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO), on average about 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcoholic beverages [3] . A report by the Italian Ministry of Health from 2015 highlighted that 64.5% of Italians over the age of 11 years consumed an alcoholic beverage at least once in their life, with a clear majority among males compared to females [4] . Furthermore, it was reported that between 11 and 24 years the consumption of alcoholic beverages occurred often outside meals [4] . According to the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), Spanish women with high education are more likely to be hazardous drinkers than less educated women, while men with low education are more likely to drink at risk [5] . College students report a greater increase in drinking than their peers who do not attend colleges and universities [6] . In addition to alcohol abuse, binge drinking, especially on weekends, is an increasing phenomenon among university students [7] . At the European level, it has emerged that two-thirds of university students are high-risk drinkers [8] . There are marked differences in the type of drink consumed. Worldwide, 44.8% of alcohol is consumed in the form of spirits, the most consumed beverage in the regions of Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, followed by beer (34.3%) and wine (11.7%) [4] . In the last 20 years, the portion of liters of wine consumed has decreased, while beer has increased, in Italy [4] . In 2016, 54% of alcohol per capita consumption among the Spanish population aged 15 years and older was of beer, followed by 28% of spirits, and 18% of wine [9] . Although the daily consumption of moderate quantities of red wine is a well-established custom of the eating habits of the Mediterranean area [3] , the adverse effects remain predominant [10] . Moreover, it has been recently pointed out that messages on the benefits of moderate wine drinking should be avoided, also considering the other sources of polyphenols in the Mediterranean diet (MD) [11] . Besides, the perceived utility of warnings on alcoholic beverages in Italy was high among university students with moderate intake, but low among those with an at-risk consumption [12] . When the compliance with the recommendations of the MD pyramid was evaluated among Italians, the regular consumption of fruits and vegetables was significantly more common in females, and it increased with age and education (84.7% of those with a university degree) [13] . Controversial results came from studies that evaluated the relationship between alcohol consumption and adherence to the MD in Spain [14] [15] [16] ; however, in addition to high alcohol intake, factors that predicted a worse diet in Spanish university students included male gender and living alone [17] . The university population is divided into two categories: those who live with their parents and those who live away from home [18] . The reasons that influence food choices made by students include a change in lifestyle, the convenience of fast-food, and the taste [18] . It has been recently reported that familiarity with coffee/tea characterized by a higher bitterness and astringency was lower in individuals high in food neophobia (FN) [19] . The latter has been defined by psychologists as the reluctance to eat unfamiliar foods [20] , and it was associated with both low adherence to MD [21] and low familiarity with vegetables, irrespective of their sensory properties, in Italian adults [19] . Nonetheless, FN correlated with a low vegetable consumption in Spanish schoolchildren [22] . This work aimed to relate alcohol consumption among university students to the FN and to the adherence to MD. The latter was assessed with validated questionnaires that assigned different scores to wine consumption.",

The study was carried out from July 2019 to September 2021. Undergraduate and doctoral students aged between 18 and 35 years were recruited through verbal disclosure, e-mails, and notice boards at La Sapienza University of Rome and UCAM. All the volunteers included in the study signed the informed consent, accompanied by an informative note, and the recruiter assigned them an alphanumeric code to guarantee privacy during the data processing and analysis phases. To collect information about eating habits and lifestyle, on-line standardized questionnaires were administered: Alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) [23] [24] [25] , Mediterranean diet score (MDS-14) [26] , Mediterranean score (MED-55) [27, 28] , questionnaire to measure Mediterranean diet (QueMD) [29] , and the food neophobia scale (FNS) [20] . A questionnaire was used to evaluate the consumption of several beverages (alcohol, coffee, and tea) and another questionnaire was administered to collect general information (age, sex, course degree, and residence: with family or away from home). Height and weight were measured with a SECA 217 portable stadiometer and balance OMRON BF511, respectively. The OMRON BF511 used the height information to calculate the body mass index (BMI) classification according to the values for obesity judgment proposed by WHO: underweight, BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 ; normal weight, BMI between 18.5 kg/m 2 and 24.9 kg/m 2 ; overweight, BMI from 25 kg/m 2 to 29.9 kg/m 2 ; obese, BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 .",

Items are selected to measure the three conceptually distinct dimensions of intake (items 1-3), dependence (items 4-6), and adverse consequences of drinking (items 7-10) [23] . Apart from the last two items, AUDIT questions allude to the previous year, and the score assigned to each item-that ranges from 0 to 4-is generally based on the frequency of occurrence. A score of 8 or more is considered to indicate hazardous or harmful alcohol use [24, 25] . Nevertheless, a cut-off point of 6 has been suggested for women since the original score yielded lower sensitivities and higher specificities for women than for men. The differentiated cut-off scores would correct the gender discrepancies in the sensitivity of the measure [24] . Scores \u2265 16 are associated with harmful drinking for men and women, while scores \u2265 20 with alcohol dependence [23] .",

From the FNS questionnaire, it emerged that 5.8% of the Italian sample had a maximum predisposition to taste new foods, and 26.2% (23.8% of males and 27.9% of females) had a greater reluctance to try new foods. Regarding Spanish students, 6.5% (4.8% of males and 7.3% of females) had food neophilia, and 14.5% (9.5% of males and 17.1% of females) have reported a score higher than the cut-off point of 28.

We observed that Italian university students who live with their parents eat much more fruit, vegetables, fish, and legumes, whereas the departure from the ideal MD model seems much more pronounced among the non-resident students. This choice can be attributed not only to their greater independence but also to the economic limitations that push them to spend less on the purchase of food [18] . In fact, they tend to consume high-energy-density nutrient-free foods that are cheaper than fruit and vegetables [34, 35] .

However, 86 Italians and 53 Spaniards have reported an intake of less than 300 mL of alcoholic beverages per day, which is the maximum required to be considered adherent to MD, according to the MED-55 score [27] . In the study conducted by L\u00f3pez-Moreno et al. [15] , the questionnaire from the PREDIMED study (MDS-14) was used, and it was reported that a high percentage of the students did not reach the intake of wine for the assignment of one point. On the other hand, Rodr\u00edguez-Mu\u00f1oz et al. [16] and Carlos et al. [14] used the Mediterranean diet quality index for children and adolescents (KIDMED), not including alcoholic beverages, to evaluate the relationship between hazardous alcohol use and MD adherences in Spanish university students. Rodr\u00edguez-Mu\u00f1oz et al. [16] reported that the students who declared eating fruit or drinking fruit juice every day, appreciating pulses, and using olive oil, had a lower tendency to drink heavily, assessed with AUDIT. Carlos et al. [14] found no relationship between the level of alcohol consumption and the degree of adherence to MD [14] . Accordingly, we found no relevant differences between the preference for alcoholic beverages and adherence to MD with MDS-14 and MED-55. The low relationship may be due to the consumption of other alcoholic beverages. In particular, 56.5% of Italians and 53.2% of Spaniards have reported drinking a bottle of beer (33 cl) within a day, 4.4% of Italians and 12.8% of Spaniards consumed two bottles within a day, whereas only one Spanish female student declared to consume eight bottles of beer within a day. Furthermore, 22.8% of Italians and 22.5% of Spaniards consumed hard liquor (40 mL), whereas 29.35% of Italians and 17.0% of Spaniards consumed an alcoholic cocktail (40 mL). There is an inconsistency between the MED-55 and the food pyramid proposed by Vitiello et al. [38] regarding the score assigned to the intake of red meat and dairy products. Furthermore, the MDS-14 includes the negative consumption of butter, which is not contemplated in the MED-55, that takes into consideration the consumption of milk and derivatives, assigning a lower score for a high frequency of consumption. However, due to the low score of MD adherence assigned to alcohol consumption, regardless of the type of beverage, MED-55 can be considered healthier according to the latest Italian national guidelines for nutrition [39] and to the \"Healthy Hydration Pyramid\" of the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) [40] .",

From the aMED (including vegetables, fresh fruits, dried fruits, wholegrain cereals, pulses, fish, and olive oil) it emerged that 37.6% of the sample had poor adherence to MD, whereas the analysis of MED-55 has revealed that no subject had low adherence to this dietary pattern. Significant differences in ntMED (including carbonated and/or sugar-sweetened beverages (soft drinks), butter, margarine, or cooking cream, and manufactured sweets, pastries, and cakes), between Italians and Spaniards, were not found. However, there were negative correlations between AUDIT and QueMD (p < 0.05), and AUDIT and ntMED (p < 0.01)-the score that includes foods not typical of MD (usually consumed on Saturday night among Spaniards)-but no relationship between AUDIT and others MD scores, including aMED. Therefore, no typical MD foods had the greatest impact on our sample, especially among Spaniards. In agreement, in the study conducted by Rodr\u00edguez-Mu\u00f1oz et al. [16] the Spanish university students who declared going to a fast-food restaurant more than once a week, and eating sweets and candy several times every day, had a higher tendency to be at risk of excessive alcohol consumption [16] .",

Participants were predominantly women and students of the scientific area; however, similar limitations were reported in a larger study [15] . The major limitation of our study is the limited sample size. Therefore, the generalization to the whole population of university students cannot be accomplished. However, moderate adherence to MD was observed, and females had a higher adherence to MD (assessed with aMED) than males, in accordance with other studies [41] [42] [43] [44] . Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has represented a limitation to this study since it has induced strong changes in the lifestyle and eating habits of university students and limited recruitment. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students have reduced their quantity of drinking owing to the closing of the pubs, and returning to live with their parents may have been a protective factor for heavy drinking [45, 46] . On the other hand, students who presented more symptoms of depression and anxiety during lockdown have reported an increased alcohol consumption [47] . Therefore, further research is needed to demonstrate the association between alcohol intake and specific dietary patterns.",

However, being far from home and the Saturday night consumption of alcoholic beverages, different from wine, can be risk factors for alcohol use disorders, assessed with AUDIT. The latter correlated with non-typical MD foods consumption. Questionnaires for the evaluation of MD adherence considered and/or assigned scores to wine consumption in a different way, and only MED-55 assigned a low score to alcohol consumption, regardless of the type of beverage. This must be kept in mind when comparing data from different studies, and the use of more than one score could be useful. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that no typical MD foods consumption, rather than typical MD intake, had the greatest impact in our sample, and that Saturday night consumption and being far from home can be risk factors for excessive alcohol consumption.
